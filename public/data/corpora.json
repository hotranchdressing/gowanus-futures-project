'§ 9601-9675, and the National\nOil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, 40 CFR Part 300. This\ndecision document explains the factual and legal basis for selecting a remedy to\naddress the contaminated sediments at the Site. The attached Administrative Record\nIndex (see Appendix III) identifies the items that comprise the Administrative Record\nupon which the selected remedy is based.\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) was\nconsulted on the proposed remedy in accordance with CERCLA Section 121(f), 42\nU.S.C. ' 9621(f), and it concurs with the selected remedy (see Appendix IV).\nASSESSMENT OF THE SITE\nActual or threatened releases of hazardous substances from the Site, if not addressed\nby implementing the response action selected in this ROD, may present an imminent\nand substantial endangerment to public health, welfare or the environment.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SELECTED REMEDY\nThe selected remedy, which addresses contaminated sediment, includes the following\ncomponents:\n Dredging of the entire column of hazardous substance-contaminated sediments\nwhich have accumulated above the native sediments in the upper and mid-\nreaches of the canal (referred to as “soft sediments”).\n In-situ stabilization (ISS)1 of those native sediments in select areas in the upper\n1 Mixing of materials, such as Portland cement, into the sediments to bind the contaminants\nand mid-reaches of the canal contaminated with high levels of nonaqueous\nphase liquid (NAPL).2\n Construction of a multilayered cap in the upper and mid-reaches of the canal to\nisolate and prevent the migration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nand residual NAPL from native sediments.\n Dredging of the entire soft sediment column in the lower reach of the canal.\n Construction of a multilayer cap to isolate and prevent the migration of PAHs\nfrom native sediments in the lower reach of the canal.\n Off-Site treatment of the NAPL-impacted sediments dredged from the upper and\nmid-reaches of the canal with thermal desorption,3 followed by beneficial reuse\noff-Site (e.g., landfill daily cover) if possible.\n Off-Site stabilization of the less contaminated sediments dredged from the lower\nreach of the canal and the sediments in the other reaches not impacted by\nNAPL, followed by beneficial reuse off-Site.\n Excavation and restoration of approximately 475 feet of the filled-in former 1st\nStreet turning basin.\n Excavation and restoration of the portion of the 5th Street turning basin beginning\nunderneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and extending approximately 25 feet to the\neast and the installation of a barrier or interception system at the eastern\nboundary of the excavation.\n Implementation of institutional controls incorporating the existing fish\nconsumption advisories (modified, as needed), as well as other controls to\nprotect the integrity of the cap.\n Periodic maintenance of the cap and long-term monitoring to insure that the\nremedy continues to function effectively.\n Combined sewer overflow (CSO)4 controls as discussed below.\nTo prevent recontamination of the canal following the implementation of the above-\ndescribed remedial actions, the upland sources of hazardous substances, including\ndischarges from three former manufactured gas plants (MGPs), CSOs, other\ncontaminated upland areas and unpermitted pipes along the canal, must be addressed\nprior to the commencement of, or in phased coordination with, the implementation of the\nselected remedy.\nThe former MGP facilities are being addressed by National Grid, a potentially\nresponsible party (PRP) for these facilities and the Site, under NYSDEC oversight.\nBased upon the first NYSDEC-selected remedy at one of these former MGP facilities\nand NYSDEC guidance for presumptive remedies at former MGP facilities, it is\nassumed that a range of actions will be implemented at the facilities (that may include\nphysically/chemically.\n2 Concentrated liquid contamination, typically oil-like, that forms a separate phase and is not\nmiscible with water.\n3 Utilization of heat to increase the volatility of organic contaminants so that they can be\nremoved and destroyed.\n4 Combined sewers receive both sewage and stormwater flows and discharge to the canal when\nthe sewer system’s capacity is exceeded.\nii\nremoval of mobile sources, construction of cut-off walls along the canal, and active\nrecovery of NAPL near the cut-off walls for each of the former MGP facilities) which will\nprevent the migration of contamination from the former MGP facilities into the canal.\nThe cleanup of the former MGP facilities will be completed in accordance with\nschedules agreed upon between the EPA and NYSDEC. In the unlikely event that\ntimely and effective state-selected remedial actions are not implemented at a given\nformer MGP facility, the EPA may implement actions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure\nthe protectiveness of the selected remedy.\nNYSDEC is currently overseeing work being performed by New York City (NYC) to\nreduce CSOs to the canal by approximately 34 percent in middle and lower canal\noutfalls. To significantly reduce overall contaminated solid discharges to the canal, the\nselected remedy also includes the following CSO control measures for the upper reach\nof the canal:\n Construction of in-line sewage/stormwater retention tanks to retain stormwater\nwhich currently discharges through outfalls RH-034 and OH-007. It is estimated\nthat an 8-million gallon tank and a 4-million gallon tank will be required to\naddress CSOs from outfalls RH-034 and OH-007, respectively. In addition,\noutfalls located in the vicinity of outfalls RH-034 and OH-007 that contribute\nsmaller CSOs will be connected to the retention tanks. The location of the\nretention tanks will be determined during the remedial design. While the sizes of\nthe tanks will be determined during the remedial design, they are expected to\nconform with the requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and to\naccommodate projected additional loads to the combined sewer system that\nresult from current and future residential development, as well as periods of high\nrainfall, including future rainfall increases that may result from climate change.\n In the event that the permanent measures described above are not implemented\nin a timely manner, interim controls, such as temporary solids capture and\nremoval, will be implemented to mitigate sediment from the CSO discharges\nuntil the permanent measures have been implemented.5\n Implementation of appropriate engineering controls to ensure that hazardous\nsubstances and solids from separated stormwater, including from future upland\ndevelopment projects, are not discharged to the canal.\nCurrent and future high density residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal\nand within the sewershed shall adhere to NYC rules for sewer connections (Chapter 31\nof Title 15 of the Rules of the City of New York) and shall be consistent with current\nNYC Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) criteria (NYCDEP, 2012) and\nguidelines to ensure that hazardous substances and solids from additional sewage\nloads do not compromise the effectiveness of the permanent CSO control measures by\nexceeding their design capacity.\nSince the EPA is incorporating contaminated CSO solids control in the remedy\n5 It is unlikely that permanent measures to control the CSO discharges will be in place before\nthe commencement of the remediation of the canal sediments.\niii\nselection, siting, remedial design and remedial action pursuant to the authority of\nCERCLA, certain CERCLA statutory authorities including, but not limited to, permit\nexemption and environmental impact statement functional equivalency apply. The EPA\nseeks to coordinate the CERCLA and CWA processes to the extent practicable, to\nensure that the selected CERCLA remedy is implemented in an effective and timely\nmanner.\nThe selected remedy also includes the following measures for discharges from upland\nsites (other than the former MGP facilities) and for unpermitted pipes along the canal:\n The EPA and NYSDEC will coordinate measures to control discharges from\nupland contaminated areas adjacent to the canal that have already been\nreferred to NYSDEC for action. The schedule for these measures will conform\nto the schedules for the cleanup of the canal.\n Unpermitted pipe outfalls will be either controlled or eliminated.\nThe environmental benefits of the selected remedy may be enhanced by consideration,\nduring the design, of technologies and practices that are sustainable in accordance\nwith the EPA Region 2’s Clean and Green Energy Policy and NYSDEC’s Green\nRemediation Policy.6 This will include consideration of green remediation technologies\nand practices.\nThe estimated present-worth cost of the selected remedy is $506 million.\nThe selected remedy will address source materials constituting principal threats by\nthermally treating the NAPL-impacted sediments dredged from the upper and mid-\nreaches of the canal, thereby satisfying the CERCLA preference for treatment.\nDECLARATION OF STATUTORY DETERMINATIONS\nThe selected remedy meets the requirements for remedial actions set forth in CERCLA\nSection 121, 42 U.S.C. ' 9621, because it: 1) is protective of human health and the\nenvironment; 2) meets a level or standard of control of the hazardous substances,\npollutants and contaminants which at least attains the legally applicable or relevant and\nappropriate requirements under federal and state laws; 3) is cost-effective and 4)\nutilizes permanent solutions and alternative treatment (or resource recovery)\ntechnologies to the maximum extent practicable. In keeping with the statutory\npreference for treatment that reduces toxicity, mobility or volume of contaminated media\nas a principal element of the remedy, all of the contaminated sediments that are\nremoved from the canal, as well as some contaminated sediments that remain in the\ncanal, will be treated by implementing the selected remedy.\n6 See http://epa.gov/region2/superfund/green_remediation and http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/\nremediation_hudson_ pdf/der31.pdf.\niv\nBecause this remedy will result in hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants\nremaining on-Site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, a\nstatutory review will be conducted within five years after initiation of remedial action to\nensure that the remedy is, or will be, protective of human health and the environment.\nROD DATA CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST\nThe ROD contains the remedy selection information noted below.

The Gowanus Expressway and a\nviaduct for NYC subway trains pass over head. North of Hamilton Avenue, the canal is\napproximately 5,600 feet long and 100 feet wide, with a maximum water depth of\napproximately 15 feet in the main channel at low tide. There are four short turning\nbasins that branch to the east of the main channel at 4th Street, 6th Street, 7th Street\nand 11th Street. A former turning basin at 1st Street and an extension of the 4th Street\nturning basin that had been referred to as the 5th Street turning basin were filled in\nbetween 1953 and 1965 (Hunter Research et al., 2004). An extension of the 7th Street\nturning basin has also been filled. South of Hamilton Avenue, the canal widens to a\nmaximum of approximately 2,200 feet and ranges in depth from -15 to -35 feet mean\nlower low water (MLLW).2 The Gowanus Canal has no remaining natural wetlands\n(various small, unconnected areas of vegetation and intertidal habitat exist) or natural\nshoreline. The vast majority of the shoreline of the canal is lined with retaining\nstructures or bulkheads.\nThe canal is located in a mixed residential-commercial-industrial area. It borders\nseveral residential neighborhoods, including Gowanus, Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll\nGardens and Red Hook, with housing located within one block of the canal. The\nwaterfront properties abutting the canal are primarily commercial and industrial. Re-\nzoning of canal-front parcels to high density residential began in 2009 and further such\nre-zoning is anticipated. During major storm events, canal flooding affects broad areas\nwhich are industrial, residential and commercial in nature.\nA number of businesses use the canal for maritime commerce. All but two of the\nbusinesses are located south of 9th Street and none are located north of 4th Street. The\ncanal is also regularly used by recreational boaters (primarily, canoers and kayakers).\nA limited number of people reside in houseboats on the canal.\n1 The Site’s Superfund Site Identification Number is NYN000206222. The U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency; the New York State Department of\nEnvironmental Conservation (NYSDEC) is the support agency.\n2 As a tidally-influenced water body, the canal has two high tides and two low tides of unequal\nheight each tidal day. MLLW is the lower low water height of the two low tides.\nDespite a New York State Department of Health fish advisory covering the entire\nGowanus Canal, posted warnings and public outreach efforts, the canal is regularly\nused for fishing, particularly subsistence fishing by communities with environmental\njustice concerns surrounding the canal.\nSITE HISTORY AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES\nPrior to being developed, the area around the Gowanus Canal was occupied by\nGowanus Creek, its tributaries and lowland marshes. Before the mid-1840s, the creek\nand its tributaries were dammed and used primarily to power tide mills (Hunter\nResearch et al., 2004). By the mid-1840s, Brooklyn was rapidly growing and the\nGowanus marshes were considered to be a detriment to local development. In 1848,\nthe State of New York authorized construction of the Gowanus Canal to open the area\nto barge traffic, flush away sewage, receive stormwater and fill the adjacent lowlands\nfor development. The canal was constructed in the mid-1800s by bulkheading and\ndredging.\nThe former 1st Street turning basin3 was originally utilized to deliver coal via barges to\nthe former Brooklyn Rapid Transit Power House. The Power House consumed large\nquantities of coal. During its operating era, large coal piles surrounded the building\nuntil the plant became obsolete and was removed from service. As was noted above,\nthe 1st Street turning basin was filled in. Portions of the building were also torn down\nover time. By 1969, the 125-foot tall smokestack and dynamo sections of the Power\nHouse had been demolished and the currently extant section of the Power House was\nthe only part of the original building still standing.\nThe 4th Street turning basin extends from the main channel east to the 3rd Avenue\nbridge; the 5th Street turning basin originally continued east from there nearly to 4th\nAvenue. Both basins were completed in the early 1870s, contemporaneously with the\nmain channel of the canal. As was noted above, the 5th Street turning basin was filled\nin between 1953 and 1965. A portion of that fill extends underneath the 3rd Avenue\nbridge into the 4th Street turning basin. Sediment has further accumulated throughout\nmuch of the 4th Street turning basin.\nFollowing its construction, the canal quickly became one of the nation’s busiest\nindustrial waterways, servicing heavy industries that included manufactured gas plants\n(MGPs), coal yards, cement manufacturers, tanneries, paint and ink factories, machine\nshops, chemical plants and oil refineries. The Gowanus Canal served as an open\nsewer when it was initially constructed in the late 1860s. As a result of the poor\nenvironmental practices typical of the era, large quantities of wastes from many of\nthese operations were discharged directly into the canal. By the late 1870s, sewers\n3 The 1st and 4th Street turning basins are described in detail since they will be addressed under\nthe selected remedy.\n2\nentering the canal carried a combination of household waste, industrial effluent from\nthe MGPs and other industries and stormwater runoff (Hunter Research et al., 2004).\nThese discharges, which contained hazardous substances such as polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) (a semi-volatile organic compound [SVOC]), polychlorinated\nbiphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), caused\nthe canal to become one of New York’s most polluted waterways.\nThe initial canal design recognized the likelihood of stagnant pollution problems and\nproposed various flushing solutions. These were not, however, implemented. Studies\nand commissions have repeatedly examined methods of addressing the contamination.\nA series of unsuccessful solutions were implemented, including directing additional\nsewage discharges to the canal in order to improve flow. In 1911, NYC began\noperating the Gowanus Canal flushing tunnel to address the canal’s serious water\nquality issues. The flushing tunnel connects the head of the canal with Buttermilk\nChannel in Upper New York Bay. It was designed to improve circulation and flush\npollutants from the canal by pumping water in either direction. The flushing tunnel\nstarts at Degraw Street on Buttermilk Channel and ends on the west side of the canal\nat Douglass Street. The flushing tunnel operated until the mid-1960s, when it fell into\ndisrepair.\nThe flushing tunnel was rehabilitated and reactivated in 1999 by the NYC Department\nof Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), pumping cleaner harbor water from Buttermilk\nChannel to the canal using a rebuilt version of the 1911 propeller-based pump system.\nThereafter, NYCDEP determined that the 1990s flushing tunnel repairs were\ninadequate, because the pumping system was poorly designed, difficult to maintain\nand unable to function properly at low tide.\nDirect discharges to the canal from industrial activities were substantially reduced or\ncontrolled over time because of declining industrial activity and the implementation of\nthe Clean Water Act (CWA) in the early 1970s. Discharges from present-day industrial\noperations are regulated and permitted under the CWA’s National Pollutant Discharge\nElimination System (NPDES) and its state counterpart, the State Pollutant Discharge\nElimination System (SPDES).\nAlthough the level of industrial activity along the canal declined over the years as\nindustry shifted away from the canal, high levels of hazardous substances remain in\nthe sediments and upland sources. Discharges from upland contaminated areas\nadjacent to the canal, CSOs, storm sewers and unpermitted pipe outfalls continue to\ncontribute contaminants to the canal. The history of these sources is summarized\nbelow.\n3\nDischarges from Upland Contaminated Areas Adjacent to the Canal\nContaminated areas adjacent to the Gowanus Canal are being investigated and\nremediated under the direction of NYSDEC. The EPA is coordinating with NYSDEC on\nthese matters. Environmental investigations or cleanups are underway at the former\nFulton Municipal Works Manufactured Gas Plant, Carroll Gardens/Public Place\n(formerly known as “Citizens Gas Works”) (hereinafter, “Public Place”)4 and\nMetropolitan former MGP facilities along the canal. Until these sites are remediated,\ncontaminants from them will continue to be transported into the Gowanus Canal\nprimarily by the migration of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)5 through subsurface\nsoils and groundwater discharge of dissolved-phase contaminants. PAHs are the\nprimary contaminants of concern (COCs) from these sources.\nThe former MGP facilities are being addressed under the State Superfund and\nBrownfield Cleanup programs by National Grid, a potentially responsible party (PRP)\nfor both these facilities and the canal. NYC owns a large portion of Public Place and\nThomas Greene Park, a portion of the site where the former Fulton MGP facility\noperated. Together with National Grid, NYC is a signatory to the NYSDEC Brownfields\ncleanup order for Public Place. As the owner of these parcels, NYC may be\nconsidered a PRP for these facilities.\nThe EPA and NYSDEC have agreed to a coordinated schedule for the former MGP\nfacilities and canal sediment cleanup efforts based on the anticipated timing of the\ndredging in the canal (which will commence at the head of the canal). In January 2012,\nNYSDEC directed National Grid to begin the expedited remedial design of a cutoff wall\nas an interim remedial measure for the former Fulton MGP facility, near the head of the\ncanal. The purpose of this wall is to prevent subsurface migration of NAPL from the\nformer Fulton MGP facility into the sediments at the bottom of the canal. For the Public\nPlace former MGP facility, centrally situated near the curve in the canal (see Figure 2),\nthe remedy includes a combination of excavation and a subsurface barrier wall and tar\nextraction wells. An investigation and partial source control cleanup was implemented\nat the former Metropolitan MGP facility, the third and most southerly former MGP\nfacility, in 2003 under the State’s Voluntary Cleanup program. Since there are potential\nsource areas at this site that were not addressed by the actions taken in 2003, a\nremedial investigation (RI)6 for this site is currently underway.\nBased on the results of the EPA’s RI, additional upland areas were found to have the\npotential to contribute contaminated groundwater and NAPL to the canal and were\n4 A remedy was selected for the Public Place former MGP in 2007. The design of the selected\nremedy is approximately 50% complete.\n5 Concentrated liquid contamination, typically oil-like, that forms a separate phase and does not\ndissolve in water.\n6 The purpose of an RI is to determine the nature and extent of contamination at a site.\n4\nreferred to NYSDEC for investigation and, if necessary, remediation under the State\nSuperfund or other remedial program. Remediation schedules will be coordinated with\nthe schedule for the canal remedy. Relative to the former MGP facilities, these areas\nare much smaller potential sources and are, thus, expected to require only a fraction of\nthe time and cost to address.\nDischarges from Combined Sewer Overflows and Stormwater\nCombined sewers (sewers that receive both sewage and stormwater flows) serve 92\npercent of the Gowanus Canal watershed, storm sewers serve only 2 percent and\ndirect runoff drains 6 percent (NYCDEP, 2008a). The Owls Head and Red Hook\nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve the area. When an appreciable amount\nof rainfall occurs, runoff enters the combined sewers and exceeds the capacity of the\nsystem and the Owls Head and Red Hook combined sewer systems overflow to the\ncanal. There are ten active CSOs and three stormwater outfalls discharging to the\nGowanus Canal (see Figure 3 for the locations). Four of the CSO outfalls account for\n95 percent of the annual discharge. The greatest annual discharge volume is from\noutfall RH-034, located at the head of the canal (121 million gallons; NYCDEP, 2008a).\nThe CSO discharges result in point source loading of high-organic-content solids and\nassociated hazardous substances to the canal.\nIn 2008, NYCDEP prepared a Gowanus Canal Waterbody/Watershed Facility Plan\nReport (WB/WS Plan) as part of its City-Wide Long-Term CSO Control Planning\nProject (NYCDEP, 2008a). This work is being performed under an Administrative Order\non Consent (AOC) between NYCDEP and NYSDEC.7 The goal of that project is to\nimplement a series of improvements to achieve compliance with water quality\nstandards under the CWA. Specific objectives of the plan include eliminating odors,\nreducing floatables and improving dissolved oxygen concentrations to meet surface-\nwater-quality standards. NYCDEP’s planned improvements for the Gowanus Canal\ninclude continued implementation of programmatic controls, modernization of the\nGowanus Canal Flushing Tunnel, reconstruction of the Gowanus Wastewater Pump\nStation, cleaning/inspection of the outfall OH-007 floatables/solids trap, repairs to the\nBond-Lorraine Street sewer main, periodic water body floatables skimming and CSO\nsediment mound dredging.\nIn July 2010, the flushing tunnel was shut down by NYCDEP to perform facility\nimprovements. This effort includes the installation of more efficient pumping systems,\nwhich will increase the volume of water by approximately 40 percent under a peak\ndesign flow. The reconstruction of the Gowanus Wastewater Pump Station, which\nbegan in February 2010, will increase the pumping capacity to deliver sewage to the\nRed Hook WWTP. All of these ongoing improvements are projected to decrease the\n7 NYSDEC Case No. CO2-20000107-8 dated January 14, 2005 and updated on April 14, 2008,\nSeptember 3, 2009 and March 8, 2012.\n5\noverall discharge to the entire canal by approximately 34 percent.\nHowever, the greatest changes in annual CSO discharge are concentrated in the\nmiddle and lower portions of the canal. Although outfall RH-034 at the head of the\ncanal has been projected to experience fewer discharge events per year, its total\nannual flow is projected to increase approximately 5 percent. Annual CSO discharges\nfrom RH-034 and OH-007 will still contribute approximately 97 percent of the total\nannual CSO flow into the canal.\nThe completion of the flushing tunnel and pump station improvements is anticipated by\nSeptember 2014. The cumulative impact of these projected flow reductions and\nflushing improvements on sediment transport and deposition throughout the canal\ncannot currently be predicted with a high degree of confidence, although preliminary\nmodeling by National Grid indicates that contaminated CSO solids will still be trapped\nin the canal even with enhanced flushing tunnel flow. Following the upgrades to the\nflushing tunnel and pump station, NYCDEP will conduct post-construction monitoring\nand then will begin the planning and public participation related to a CWA Long-Term\nControl Plan (LTCP)8 which will analyze the next stage of CSO-related improvements\nfor the canal. The LTCP is to be submitted to NYSDEC in June 2015.\nNYCDEP also plans a sewer separation project in a 96-acre area around Carroll Street\nfor flood control purposes. It is projected that this effort will result in an additional\noverall CSO reduction of 5 percent when it is completed in 2022. However, the PAHs\nin the stormwater component of the CSO will still discharge to the canal.\nNYCDEP is also undertaking a green infrastructure effort9 that will result in an\nestimated 10 percent CSO reduction in stormwater discharges to the entire canal over\nan extended period of time (20-30 years) (NYCDEP, 2012). Two pilot projects for the\ncontrol of street runoff along the Gowanus Canal (the DL and Studio’s Sponge Park at\n2nd Street, on the Carroll Gardens side of the canal and the Gowanus Conservancy\ngreen infrastructure at 2nd Avenue on the Park Slope side) are being supported by\nfederal and NYC grants.\nIt should be noted that NYC’s sewer system operations include the treatment and\ndisposal of hazardous substances consistent with the categorical pretreatment\n8 An LTCP is a phased approach for control of CSOs that requires a permittee to develop and\nsubmit an approvable plan that will ultimately result in compliance with CWA requirements\nand New York State water quality standards.\n9 Green infrastructure is a network of open spaces and natural areas, such as rooftop gardens\nand vegetated swales, which naturally manage stormwater, thereby reducing storm runoff\ninto the storm sewers.\n6\nstandards promulgated under 40 CFR § 430.5, which limit the pollutant discharges to\npublically-owned treatment works from specific process wastewaters of particular\nindustrial categories. Various industrial facilities within NYC, including those operating\nwithin the Gowanus Canal sewerage area, have historically discharged and continue to\ndischarge hazardous substances to the NYC sewage system. As part of its water and\nsewer rates, NYC charges for such disposal through the sewers. NYC has operated\nan Industrial Pre-treatment Program (IPP), as required by federal regulations, since\n1987 in order to help protect the sewers, the wastewater treatment plants and NYC's\nreceiving waters. As part of the IPP, NYCDEP issues permits for and inspects IPP\nfacilities. CSO events, however, may result in the discharge of sanitary sewage and\nhazardous substances disposed of by non-regulated users or picked up from captured\nstormwater. Some of these hazardous substances tend to bind to the organic solids\npresent in the sewage.\nThe WB/WS Plan acknowledges that solids associated with CSO events will continue\nto be discharged to the canal following implementation of the current upgrades. In\nresponse, the WB/WS Plan includes an analysis which suggests that the upgraded\nflushing tunnel will disperse the solids more evenly throughout the canal and into the\nharbor than in the past (NYCDEP, 2007a). In conducting this analysis and describing\nfuture operations, the WB/WS Plan has effectively memorialized the canal’s historic\nrole as an extension of NYC’s sewer system. The canal, particularly the upper canal,\nhas and will continue to function as a sewage retention basin. Among other things, this\nhistoric and on-going usage has created CSO mounds located at the head of the canal.\nThe WB/WS Plan again calls for dredging these mounds, a measure which has been\nauthorized but not implemented since 1983 (NYCDEP, 2008a).\nUnpermitted Pipe Outfalls\nNearly 250 outfalls were identified and inspected during the RI, most of which were\npipes located on private property. In general, these are unused pipes associated with\nhistoric industrial activities. Twenty-five of these pipe outfalls were observed to be\nactively discharging during dry weather (about a third of these discharges may have\nbeen tidal backflow). The flow rate from all but one of the active outfalls was very small\n(the majority are estimated to be less than 1 liter/minute).\nPermitted Pipe Outfalls\nA review of NYSDEC and the EPA databases identified five active permitted\ndischarges to the canal. During the RI, discharges were not observed in three of these\npermitted outfalls. Two of the permitted outfalls could not be clearly identified because\nof the large number of outfalls in their vicinity.\n7\nPrior Dredging of the Canal\nThe canal’s narrow 100-foot width upstream of the Gowanus Expressway is the entire\nnavigational channel, unlike many river and harbor sites where the shipping channel\nrepresents a fraction of the total area of the water body. In the upper two-thirds of the\ncanal, NYC has primary responsibility for maintaining the navigational depths.\nLimited recent dredging of the canal has been performed and documentation of\nhistorical dredging is sparse. There are no federal, state or local regulatory\nrequirements related to the depth of the canal north of Hamilton Avenue. Below\nHamilton Avenue, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) previously performed\nmaintenance dredging.\nWhile NYCDEP has obtained State approvals for successive water quality\nimprovement-related dredging (1983, 1993 and 2008), no major dredging has been\nperformed in the canal in three decades. The current plan for dredging the CSO\nmounds at the head of the canal is scheduled for completion in 2017.\nPrior Studies\nSince 1983, NYCDEP has compiled four separate major reports on water quality and\nCSOs controls for the canal, each of which was approved for implementation by\nNYSDEC. Since 2003, the USACE and National Grid have each issued about a dozen\nreports regarding the canal. National Grid has completed numerous reports regarding\nits former MGP facilities and studies and/or cleanups have been conducted at another\ndozen or more upland areas.\nListing on National Priorities List\nIn April 2009, the Gowanus Canal was proposed for inclusion on the National Priorities\nList (NPL) pursuant to the Superfund law at the request of NYSDEC. Following the\nproposal for inclusion on the NPL, the EPA commenced an RI. On March 2, 2010, the\nEPA placed the Gowanus Canal on the NPL.\nIn April 2010, the EPA entered into administrative consent orders with NYC and\nNational Grid to perform work in support of the EPA’s RI and feasibility study (FS).10\nThe draft RI report was completed in January 2011 and the draft FS report was\ncompleted in December 2011. In connection with the release of these reports, the EPA\nconducted significant public outreach throughout 2011 and 2012. The outreach\nprocess included numerous public meetings with formal presentations, as well as\ninformal question and answer sessions. An FS report addendum was completed in\nDecember 2012.\n10 An FS identifies and evaluates remedial alternatives to address the contamination.\n8\nHIGHLIGHTS OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION\nDue to the technically complex issues at the Site and the significant public interest, the\nEPA greatly augmented its interaction with the community beyond what is typical for\nthe Superfund remedy selection process. Specifically, while the EPA typically releases\nRI/FS reports simultaneously with the Proposed Plan11 and conducts a public meeting\nto discuss the results of the investigation and the basis for the preferred remedy, for the\nGowanus Canal site, the RI and FS reports were released separately at the time of\ntheir respective completion in order to facilitate their review and understanding by the\npublic. The RI report was made available on the EPA’s website in January 2011 and\nthe FS report was made available on the EPA’s website in December 2011. Following\nthe release of each of these documents, the EPA held separate public meetings in the\nCarroll Gardens and Red Hook neighborhoods to present the findings. These\nmeetings were announced in the local press. Several follow-up meetings to further\ndiscuss the technical issues and the community’s concerns were held at the invitation\nof the Gowanus Canal Community Advisory Group (CAG), the local Community Boards\nand other local organizations.\nOn December 27, 2012, a press release was issued (which generated a number of on-\nline articles) and a number of e-mails were sent to the Site’s mailing list re-announcing\nthe availability of the RI and FS reports and announcing the availability of an FS\naddendum report and Proposed Plan on the EPA’s website. On December 28, 2012,\nthe RI report, FS report, FS addendum report and Proposed Plan were made available\nto the public at information repositories maintained at the Community Free Library,\nlocated at the Carroll Gardens Library, the Joseph Miccio Community Center in Red\nHook and the EPA Region II Office in NYC. A notice of availability for the above-\nreferenced documents was published in the Courier Life, Red Hook Star-Revue and\nThe Brooklyn Paper on January 4, 2013. Notices were published in these papers\nagain on January 18, 2013 to announce a revised starting time for the January 23,\n2013 public meeting. On January 23, 2013 and January 24, 2013, the EPA conducted\npublic meetings at Public School 58 (the Carroll School) and the Joseph Miccio\nCommunity Center, respectively, to present the Proposed Plan for the Site, including\nthe preferred remedy, and respond to questions and comments from the approximately\n200 attendees at the January 23, 2012 meeting and 100 attendees at the January 24,\n2012 meeting.\nAlthough serious concerns were expressed about a proposed on-Site confined disposal\nfacility (CDF)12 for the stabilized, lesser contaminated sediments at the January 24\n11 A Proposed Plan describes the remedial alternatives considered for a site and identifies the\npreferred remedy with the rationale for this preference.\n12 A secure structure designed to contain dredged sediments (in this case, after stabilization)\nwithin a waterway.\n9\nmeeting, there was clear overall support for the major components of the proposed\nremedy, similar to the support expressed during the January 23 meeting..\nPrior to the release of the Proposed Plan and the commencement of the public\ncomment period, a member of the CAG expressed concern that a 30-day comment\nperiod would be too short to provide the CAG members and other stakeholders\nsufficient time to provide technically well-informed comments. Accordingly, a 90-day\npublic comment period was announced at the time of the release of the Proposed Plan.\nIn response to a January 28, 2013 request from NYC that the public comment period\nbe extended 30 days, the comment period was extended to April 27, 2013.\nA notice announcing the extension of the public comment period to April 27, 2013 was\npublished in the Courier Life, Red Hook Star-Revue and The Brooklyn Paper on March\n22, 2013.\nDuring the comment period, in addition to the two meetings discussed above, the EPA\nheld informational meetings with the CAG in Carroll Gardens on February 11, 2013,\nand again with the Red Hook community on February 13, 2013, the residents of public\nhousing located immediately north of the canal on March 27, 2013 and the Red Hook\ncommunity on April 16, 2013, the CAG on April 23, 2013 and the residents of public\nhousing again on April 25, 2013. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss, in\nmore detail, the specifics of the Proposed Plan and to answer additional questions from\nthe community. With the exception of the April 25, 2013 meeting which was attended\nby 25 people, all of the other follow up meetings were well attended.\nThe public generally supports the dredging, capping and CSO abatement components\nof the remedy. The CAG, which is comprised of approximately 50 members\nrepresenting over 30 organizations and 20 non-organizational members, passed\nresolutions in support of the overall remedy, including 100% CSO control. Community\nBoard Six, a municipal entity which represents the neighborhoods surrounding the\ncanal, submitted comments supporting the overall remedy.\nWhile 15 businesses and approximately 700 Red Hook residents located in close\nproximity to the proposed location of the CDF expressed support for its construction,\napproximately 900 parties located in other sections of Red Hook, elsewhere in New\nYork State and in other states expressed strong opposition to the CDF option. In\naddition, No Toxic Red Hook submitted two similar petitions to the EPA containing\napproximately 2,500 original names and signatures from business owners, residents,\nusers of the recreation area and concerned citizens. The petitions express opposition\nto the processing of contaminated sediments in Red Hook and their placement in a\nCDF.\n10\nAlthough various development interests filed formal comments in opposition to\nnomination of the Site for the NPL in 2009, no comments were filed in opposition to the\nProposed Plan by the developers who have acquired property along the canal for\nresidential, commercial and other redevelopment purposes since the Site was placed\non the NPL.\nFriends of Douglass Greene Park presented the EPA with a petition with 765 parties\nexpressing opposition to the placement of an in-line sewage/stormwater retention tank\nbeneath the Douglass and Degraw community pool. The petition also sought an\nassurance from the EPA that should any disruption or displacement to the pool be\nnecessary as a result of the remediation, the park’s facilities and services would be\nprovided at a nearby location.\nNYCDEP submitted 124 pages of comments, with approximately 300 pages of\nattachments. When read in their entirety, NYCDEP’s comments state that the CSOs\ndo not contribute to unacceptable impacts to the canal, lengthy additional studies are\nneeded prior to remedy selection, further NAPL controls are needed and various\nproject complexities effectively prevent addressing the contamination in the canal.\nNational Grid submitted 43 pages of comments and 600 pages of attachments.\nNational Grid, in sum, agreed that a cleanup of the canal can be done, despite\nsignificant technical challenges, asserted that even greater CSO controls were\nwarranted and advocated for less dredging than indicated in the Proposed Plan.\nComments questioning various aspects of the remedy were also submitted by various\nother PRPs and industry-related parties. Notably, NYC was alone in stating that no\nfurther CSO controls are warranted. Industry and other PRP commenters suggested\nthat additional CSO controls beyond those set forth in the Proposed Plan are needed\nfor an effective cleanup.\nResponses to the questions and comments received at the public meetings and in\nwriting (letters, postcards and emails) during the public comment period are included in\nthe Responsiveness Summary (see Appendix V).\nThe areas adjacent to the canal historically have been residential, commercial and\nindustrial. It is well known that significant redevelopment is anticipated around the\ncanal, including high density residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal\nthat has already been approved. Therefore, it was not necessary for the EPA to solicit\nthe public’s views on reasonably-anticipated future land use. Since the area is served\nby municipal water and the aquifer is already designated as a drinking water source\n(although it is not likely that the groundwater in the vicinity of the canal will be used for\npotable purposes in the foreseeable future), it was not necessary for the EPA to solicit\nthe public’s views on potential future beneficial groundwater uses.\nThe EPA has conducted extensive community outreach during the development of the\n11\nRI/FS and Proposed Plan and is committed to maintaining a transparent, proactive\ncommunity interaction process during each cleanup phase, with informal comment\nopportunities on all key elements of the design and implementation. The EPA is\ncommitted to working with the community to minimize short-term impacts, including any\ntemporary disruptions to public amenities.\nSCOPE AND ROLE OF THE OPERABLE UNIT\nThe National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), at 40\nCFR Section 300.5, defines an operable unit as a discrete action that comprises an\nincremental step toward comprehensively addressing site problems. A discrete portion\nof a remedial response eliminates or mitigates a release, threat of a release or pathway\nof exposure. The cleanup of a site can be divided into a number of operable units,\ndepending on the complexity of the problems associated with the site.\nThe Site is being addressed as a single operable unit.\nThe EPA has the primary responsibility under CERCLA for investigating and\nremediating the canal sediments. By agreement between the EPA and NYSDEC,\nNYSDEC has the primary responsibility for the investigation and response actions\nrelated to the upland properties adjacent to the canal and the CSOs under the CWA.\nAddressing ongoing contaminant contributions to the canal from active sources is a\nprerequisite to a sustainable remedy for canal sediments.\nThe primary objectives of the response action are to remediate the contaminated\nsediments in the Gowanus Canal in order to reduce or eliminate unacceptable human\nhealth and ecological risks from exposure to the contaminated sediments, and to\nprevent recontamination of canal sediments after the remedy is implemented.\nContaminated groundwater that is migrating to the canal from the upland sources is\nbeing addressed by a combination of federal and state response actions. Groundwater\nand NAPL source areas associated with the former MGP facilities are being addressed\nby NYSDEC, in coordination with the EPA, under existing and anticipated MGP\nprogram response action decisions.\nThe EPA screened other upland source areas to identify locations where NAPL may\nhave the potential to migrate through the subsurface into the canal. Of the areas\nidentified through this process, the EPA currently plans to address a portion of the 1st\nStreet turning basin and the portion of the 4th Street turning basin located underneath\nthe 3rd Avenue bridge through this response action decision, while 400 Carroll Street13\nwill be addressed through a non-time-critical removal action consistent with this\nresponse action decision.\n13 A former oil terminal facility and location of a suspected coal tar hotspot.\n12\nAdditional source areas (e.g., Chemtura Corp.14 and 627 Smith Street15) are already\nbeing addressed under various NYSDEC cleanup programs, such as the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and state Brownfields redevelopment. The\nremainder of the EPA-identified upland groundwater source areas have been referred\nto NYSDEC for further investigation. These parcels will be addressed, as necessary, in\nseparate response action decisions under NYSDEC authority, in coordination with the\nEPA. If any additional groundwater contamination source areas which threaten the\neffectiveness of the selected remedy are later identified, the EPA or NYSDEC will\naddress such locations, as appropriate.\nThe cost of response actions, such as the former MGP facilities, Chemtura and\nBrownfields, which are being or will be addressed through separate decision\ndocuments, are not included in this decision document.\nSUMMARY OF SITE CHARACTERISTICS\nSite Hydrology\nThe Gowanus Canal is a tidally influenced, dead-end channel that opens to Gowanus\nBay and Upper New York Bay (see Figure 1). The canal experiences a semidiurnal\ntidal cycle (i.e., two high tides and two low tides of unequal height each tidal day), with\na vertical tidal range from 4.7 to 5.7 feet. The only fresh surface water inflows to the\ncanal are wet-weather CSO and stormwater discharges. Because of its narrow width,\nlimited freshwater input and enclosed upper end, the canal has low current speeds and\nlimited tidal exchange with Gowanus Bay. Circulation is enhanced by the addition of\nwater from the flushing tunnel located at the head of the canal, when it is operating\n(NYCDEP, 2008a).\nThe canal upstream of the Gowanus Expressway has been designated “Use Class\nSD,” which indicates that the surface waters should be suitable for fish survival, as\ndescribed in Title 6 NYCRR Part 701. The area downstream of the Gowanus\nExpressway is designated “Use Class I,” which indicates that the waters should be\nsuitable for finfish propagation and survival as described in Title 6 NYCRR Part 701.\nSite Hydrogeology\nFour geologic units (in order of increasing depth and age) lie beneath the area\nsurrounding the Gowanus Canal:\n Fill\n14 A former laboratory and chemical manufacturing facility located at 633 and 688 Court Street.\n15 The former Barrett Manufacturing Co. asphalt roofing facility.\n13\n Alluvial/marsh deposits\n Glacial sands and silts\n Bedrock\nFill materials are associated with canal construction and subsequent industrialization\nand regrading of the area, much of which was originally marshland. The fill consists of\nsilts, sands and gravels mixed with ash and fragments of brick, metal, glass, concrete,\nwood and other debris.\nThe alluvial/marsh deposits lie below the fill and are composed of sands (alluvial\ndeposits from flowing water bodies), peat organic silts and clays (marsh deposits).\nThese alluvial/marsh deposits are associated with the original wetlands complex (i.e.,\nnative sediment) that was present when the area was settled.\nA thick sequence of glacial deposits occurs below the alluvial/marsh deposits. The full\nthickness of the glacial deposits was not penetrated in the RI, but the observed glacial\ndeposits were composed mostly of coarser grain sediments (sands and gravel) and\noccasional beds of silt. These glacial sands, silts and gravel were deposited as glacial\nice melted during the retreat of the last ice age. At the base of the glacial sequence lies\na layer of dense clay, deposited by the glacier or prior to glaciation.\nWeathered and competent bedrock underlies the glacial deposits. The bedrock\nconsists of a medium- to coarse-grained metamorphic rock known as the Fordham\nGneiss (GEI, 2005).\nThe primary aquifer beneath the Gowanus Canal and surrounding uplands is identified\nas the Upper Glacial Aquifer, which generally occurs in the thick sequence of glacial\ndeposits but may include sandy units in the alluvial/marsh sediments. The Upper\nGlacial Aquifer appears to be generally unconfined, although local beds of silt and clay\nmay confine underlying sand beds. In the Upper Glacial Aquifer, regional groundwater\nflows to the west/southwest toward Gowanus Bay. Groundwater-bearing zones in the\nfill and alluvial/marsh deposits discharge to the canal.\nThe canal is located within the area designated for the Brooklyn Queens Sole Source\nAquifer. Groundwater is not, however, used as a potable water supply in this part of\nBrooklyn.\nMultiple lines of evidence were developed in the RI to characterize the hydraulic\nrelationships between local groundwater and the canal. Potentiometric surfaces\ndeveloped from the synoptic (instantaneous points in time) measurement events\nsuggest that, at the water table, groundwater flows toward the canal. Potentiometric\ndata from intermediate wells screened in the glacial deposits depict a more complex\npattern, with groundwater generally flowing upward toward the canal, which is typical of\n14\na discharge area. Data from a five-day tidal evaluation indicate that at specific locations\nadjacent to the canal, canal elevations at high tide consistently exceeded groundwater\nelevations in the shallow fill/alluvium, creating hydraulic conditions for surface water to\nintermittently flow into shallow aquifer sediments.\nSediment Characteristics\nThe sediments in the canal consist of two distinct layers. The upper layer is referred to\nas “soft sediment.” The soft sediment has accumulated in the canal over time since the\ncanal was last dredged. The soft sediment layer ranges in thickness from\napproximately 1 foot to greater than 20 feet, with an average thickness of about 10\nfeet. The thickest deposits are found at the head of the canal and within the turning\nbasins. The soft sediment consists, generally, of a dark gray to black sand/silt/clay\nmixture that contains variable amounts of gravel, organic matter (e.g., leaves, twigs,\nvegetative debris)16 and trash. Odors described as “organic,” “septic-like,” “sulfur-like,”\nand “hydrocarbon-like” were commonly detected in the soft sediment during the RI, as\nwere visible sheens. The soft sediments are underlain by the alluvial and marsh\ndeposits of the Gowanus Creek complex that were present prior to the canal’s\nconstruction. These deposits are referred to as “native” sediments and consist of\nbrown, tan and light-gray sands, silts, silty sand, sandy clay, clay and peat.\nSediment coring data produced by the EPA and National Grid document the presence\nof high-organic content sediments that adsorb and retain contaminants, including\nPAHs. Many of these sediments also contain visible sheens, indicating the presence of\nundissolved petroleum hydrocarbons or coal tar. Specifically, the total organic carbon\n(TOC) content is substantially higher in Gowanus Canal surface sediments than in the\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference area sediments, with averages of\n6.4 and 2.8 percent, respectively. The high TOC content of the surface of the soft\nsediment reflects the impact of CSO discharges to the canal. NYCDEP has estimated\nthe loading of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to the canal and noted that CSOs\ndominate these loadings relative to stormwater runoff (NYCDEP, 2008a). BOD is\nanother measure of organic matter in a sample. High concentrations of organic\ncontaminants (i.e., PAHs associated with NAPL) appear to have increased the TOC\nmeasurements in some samples. Other physical characteristics of each sediment type\nin the Gowanus Canal and Upper New York Bay reference area (i.e., grain size\ndistribution, percent solids, sulfide concentration and bulk density) are described in the\nFS report.\n16 While the soft sediments are comprised of mineral grains, naturally-occurring organic\nmaterial and sewage, as is noted in the “Nature and Extent of Contamination” section,\nbelow, these sediments are heavily contaminated with PAHs, PCBs, metals and VOCs.\n15\nShoreline and Bulkhead Characteristics\nNYCDEP (NYCDEP, 2008b) has documented that the shorelines of the Gowanus\nCanal are entirely altered. While there are areas where the shoreline consists of riprap\nand piers, the shorelines are dominated by bulkheads (NYCDEP, 2008b).\nA bulkhead inventory performed along the entire length of the canal by Brown Marine\nConsulting (2000) indicated that there are four primary types of bulkheads:\n Crib-type bulkheads, which are constructed of interlocking timbers or logs that are\nfilled with backfill to form a type of gravity retaining structure.\n Gravity retaining walls, which are built so that the weight of the wall itself provides\nstability.\n Relieving platforms, which consist of a deck of timber or concrete supported on\npiles, typically timbers or logs, at an elevation high enough above the mean low\nwater17 line to not require underwater construction techniques but low enough to\nkeep the pilings continuously submerged.\n Steel sheet-pile bulkheads, which are flexible walls constructed of steel sheets with\ninterlocking joints. The steel is capped with concrete or masonry construction.\nAnchorage systems prevent outward movement and consist of tie-rods and anchors\n(e.g., structures buried inshore of the bulkhead, such as massive concrete blocks or\nsteel sheet-piles). The bulkheads north of Hamilton Avenue are generally\nconstructed of wood or steel.\nThe survey concluded that the existing structures were sufficient only to support\npresent loading conditions and that any type of dredging activity could threaten\nbulkhead stability due to the deteriorated condition of the structures. The survey was\nbased only on visual examinations of structures without physical or laboratory testing\nand recommended that a more thorough investigation of bulkhead integrity be\nperformed if dredging is planned. The report also noted that an estimated 42 percent of\nthe bulkhead length was in fair condition or worse.\nHunter Research et al. (2004) quantified bulkhead conditions in 2003. In that survey,\nthey evaluated bulkhead construction and determined that approximately 73 percent of\nthe bulkheads along the main canal and turning basins were crib-type bulkheads with\ntimber construction. Approximately 10 percent of the bulkheads consisted of concrete\nor bridge abutments and 17 percent were timber or steel sheet-piling-type barriers.\nLimited environmental investigations of the shoreline were conducted immediately\nadjacent to the canal and beyond the limits of the upland source areas. These\n17 The average of all the low water heights.\n16\ninvestigations revealed the presence of coal tar at certain locations in the canal bank at\nthe same elevation as the tar in the canal. These findings suggest that tar might have\nmigrated along the canal and re-infiltrated into the bank at locations away from the\noriginal source areas. These areas of bank-stored tar may act as secondary sources\nof contamination to the canal.\nAreas of Archaeological or Historical Importance\nIn 2006, the Gowanus Canal Historic District was found eligible for the National and\nState Registers of Historic Places by the New York State Historic Preservation Office\n(SHPO).18 The district was identified as a result of an eligibility study undertaken by\nHunter Research in 2004 for the USACE. Additional contributing resources were\nidentified by the SHPO in 2008 following a cultural resources study undertaken in\nresponse to a proposed Toll Brothers project at 363-365 Bond Street.\nThe EPA supplemented this information during the RI/FS. Documentary research and\na high-resolution side-scan sonar survey performed for the RI identified known historic\nresources in the form of the canal bulkheads, as well as anomalies on the canal\nbottom, which will be the subject of further investigation. The variety of bulkheads\nreflects an evolution of technology, a varied use of materials and an effective means of\nmaintaining the function of the canal, thus ensuring its role in the commercial\ndevelopment of Brooklyn.\nA historical and archaeological study of the Gowanus Canal was carried out as part of\nthe FS to assist the EPA in meeting its obligations under Section 106 of the National\nHistoric Preservation Act and its implementing procedures (36 CFR Part 800). The\nstudy’s objectives were to establish prehistoric and historic contexts for identifying and\nevaluating potential subsurface features of interest that may have been buried following\nthe draining and filling of the Gowanus Creek marsh during the construction of the\ncanal from circa 1853 to 1870. As part of this report, a Historic American Engineering\nRecord (HAER) narrative history of the Gowanus Canal was prepared.\nOne conclusion of the study was that sites of potential archaeological interest exist\nwithin the Gowanus Canal project area. These include an area of prehistoric potential\nfrom the former 1st Street turning basin up to Degraw Street, the sites of three tide mill\ncomplexes, two corridors of battle action from the Battle of Brooklyn during the\n18 The district is a linear corridor following the canal channel from a point opposite Percival and\n17th Streets extending approximately 6,500 feet northeast to a point between Douglass and\nButler Streets. It includes the canal channel and bulkheads and 13 related contributing\nbuildings and structures, sharing a context within the industrial landscape that developed\nadjacent to the canal following its initial phase of construction and improvement from circa\n1853 to 1870.\n17\nRevolutionary War and two potential sites of soldier burials.\nA geotechnical evaluation of soil borings indicated that the likelihood for these sites to\nhave survived intact is very low to low but not entirely without potential. Their state of\nintegrity is unconfirmed, but if intact, they will be deeply buried at depths of at least 15\nfeet at the edges of the canal, with the greatest likelihood of intact survival existing just\noutside of the canal bulkheads (about 20 feet from the edge of the canal). Moving\naway from the canal, any surviving cultural stratigraphy generally will be buried less\ndeeply (based on documented patterns of filling in the former tidal marshes) and have\na much higher likelihood of having been disturbed by more than 150 years of intensive\nurban development.\nOf greater certainty are the survival of archaeological resources associated with the\nGowanus Canal itself and the industries that grew beside it in the mid- to late 19th\ncentury. The canal and its turning basins include more than two miles of timber\ncribwork bulkheads that have been identified as part of the canal’s historic fabric and\nare likely to contain important information about the canal’s design and construction.\nWithin the canal itself are the remains of at least four shipwrecks and a high likelihood\nthat several other ship hulls have survived within the fill of the former 1st Street turning\nbasin. Canal-side industrial archaeology sites also have the potential to yield\ninformation related to specific industries and research questions about those industries’\nactivities and their impact on the natural and human environment.\nThe study also identified recommendations for further archaeological studies and\nconsiderations to be included in the remedial design in order to avoid or mitigate\nremedy impacts on potential archaeological resources. Recommendations for\nadditional cultural resources work during the remedial design phase include the\nrefinement of the archaeological “Area of Potential Effect;” targeted research on canal-\nrelated, mid- to late-19th-century industrial sites that may be impacted by ground\ndisturbances; additional, targeted geotechnical investigation; and archaeological\nmonitoring of the removal/stabilization of timber cribwork bulkheads with\ndocumentation of sample bulkheads. Specifically related to the recommended\nmonitoring, the additional effort will document the design and construction of the\ncanal’s timber cribwork and include the preparation of drawings as appropriate for\ninclusion in a supplemental HAER documentation package. Other resources identified\nfor monitoring include any identified potential industrial archaeological resources,\nmaritime resources identified by side-scan sonar in 2010, and the buried ships\nreportedly located in the former 1st Street turning basin. Further archeological studies\nmay be required to avoid or mitigate potential remedy impacts related to siting of CSO\ncontrols and any temporary water treatment or staging facilities.\nShould the bulkheads be subject to adverse effects as a result of cleanup actions, a\nwide range of mitigating measures could be implemented as part of the remedy. As\n18\nnoted above, the appropriate measures will likely include additional documentation of\nbulkhead characteristics and the incorporation of archaeological and architectural\ninvestigations. Where new bulkhead construction is required, bulkhead configurations\nthat are in keeping with the historic character of the setting will be considered.\nFurther examination of anomalies on and within the sediments will need to be\nperformed as remediation proceeds. This investigation will likely encompass further\nremote sensing and/or direct examination of items in the canal bottom.\nRESULTS OF THE REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION\nBased upon an analysis of the extensive prior studies and reports that were prepared\nfor the canal and upland areas, the following additional work was performed as part of\nthe RI: bathymetric survey; survey of outfall features, including identifying outfall\nfeatures, collecting and analyzing outfall water samples and tracing outfall features to\ntheir origin; cultural resources survey, including a bulkhead study; sediment coring;\nsurface sediment sample collection and analysis; surface water sample collection and\nanalysis; fish and shellfish tissue sample collection and analysis; air sample collection\nand analysis; CSO sediment and water sample collection and analysis; and\nhydrogeological investigation, which included groundwater monitoring well installation\nand development, soil sampling, groundwater sampling, groundwater/surface water\ninteraction sampling, synoptic measurements of water levels and tidal evaluation.\nGeophysical Surveys\nThe bathymetry of the canal was measured by the USACE in a January 2010 survey\nusing the same methodology as was used in the 2003 USACE bathymetry study\nperformed in a joint investigation with NYCDEP. The measured bottom depth\nelevations ranged from approximately -0.13 feet to -38 feet North American Vertical\nDatum 1988 (NAVD88). The bottom depth elevations measured within the canal north\nof Hamilton Avenue were typically between -0.13 feet and approximately -18 feet\nNAVD88; much lower sediment surface elevations were measured south of Hamilton\nAvenue. The sediment surface at the head of the canal and in the eastern ends of\nmany of the turning basins is exposed at low tide. Evidence of propeller scour in the\nform of a deeper sediment surface was noted in the southern portion of the canal; this\narea is subject to frequent tugboat activity to move and position oil and gravel barges at\nthe various commercial terminals near the mouth of the canal.\nDebris, such as tires, sunken barges, concrete rubble, timbers, gravel and general\ntrash, is widespread throughout the canal. A debris survey was performed in late 2005\nby National Grid using magnetometer, sub-bottom profiling and side-scan sonar\ntechnologies.\nThe combined observations from the 2003 and 2005 geophysical surveys, 2010 side-\n19\nscan sonar survey and 2010 RI field observations were used to characterize the\ndistribution of debris and obstructions in the canal. Detailed observations are provided\nin the RI/FS reports.\nExtent of Contamination\nSediment\nThe horizontal and vertical distribution of contamination in surface sediment (0-to-6-\ninch depth interval), soft sediment (from a depth of 6 inches below the sediment\nsurface to the contact with the native Gowanus Creek sediments) and native sediment\n(i.e., original Gowanus Creek alluvial and marsh deposits) were characterized on the\nbasis of field observations and chemical analysis of sediment samples.\nThe canal, especially the upper reach, is a water body contained in a constructed\nconfined space of relatively regular geometry and relatively shallow depth. Water and\nsuspended sediments from New York Harbor enter the canal through tidal exchanges\nfrom the south end and flushing tunnel flow at the northern end. Small amounts of\ndirect stormwater runoff from areas adjacent to the canal also drain directly into the\ncanal. Deposition of solids in the canal from these sources constitute the “background”\nlevel of contamination (i.e., regional contamination with no contribution from Gowanus\nCanal point sources of contamination), which should be within or slightly above the\nrange of contaminant concentrations at the reference area sampling stations in the\nharbor. For the harbor reference stations sampled during the RI, PAH concentrations\nranged from 1 mg/kg to 14 mg/kg. See Table 1 for a summary of the range and\naverage concentrations for harbor reference data for PAHs, PCBs, copper and lead\n(see Appendix II for tables). Previous studies have shown that for the entire New\nYork/New Jersey harbor system, total PAH19 concentrations in the sediment ranged\nfrom 0.7 mg/kg to 22.1 mg/kg (EPA, 1998). Data recently collected from candidate\nreference areas for the Newtown Creek Superfund site RI indicate that PAH\nconcentrations in enclosed and semi-enclosed industrial embayments without CSOs\nare comparable to the reference area concentrations measured in the Gowanus Canal\nRI.\nAll other major ongoing inputs of chemical contamination to the canal are from upland\npoint sources of contamination to the canal, including the three former MGP facilities\nand the CSO and stormwater outfalls.\nCanal sediments are affected by contaminants that are adsorbed to sediment particles\nand by the upwelling and horizontal transport of NAPL, which contains PAHs. In\nsurface sediments (0-to-6-inch depth interval), PAHs, PCBs and seven metals (barium,\n19 Total PAH is defined as the sum of detected Priority Pollutant PAHs and 2-\nmethylnaphthalene.\n20\ncadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and silver) were found to be contributing to\nunacceptable ecological and human health risks. Concentrations of these constituents\nin surface sediment were statistically significantly higher in the canal than at reference\nlocations in Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay. The average total PAH\nconcentration in surface sediment from the canal is two orders of magnitude higher\nthan the average concentration in reference area surface sediment. Average total PAH\nconcentrations in subsurface soft and native sediment are three orders of magnitude\nhigher than samples from the reference area.\nSubsurface sediment sampling data indicated that VOCs, particularly benzene,\ntoluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), and total PAHs were frequently detected at\nhigh concentrations, with PAHs detected up to 48,000 mg/kg in both the soft and native\nsediment units. The highest PAH concentrations were measured in samples that\ncontained NAPL. PCBs and metals were all frequently detected in the soft sediment,\nbut were infrequently detected or detected at lower concentrations in the native\nsediments. In the subsurface soft sediment, VOCs (primarily BTEX), PAHs, PCBs and\nmetals were all detected at substantially higher concentrations than those found in the\nsurface sediments.\nTable 2 summarizes the physical characteristics of surface, soft and native sediments\nin the canal and surface sediment in the reference area. Table 3 shows the average\nconcentrations of selected constituents in surface, soft and native sediments in the\ncanal and surface sediment in the reference area. Table 4 shows the average\nconcentrations of selected constituents in surface sediment in the upper, middle and\nlower reaches of the canal.\nThe sediment coring effort showed that NAPL contamination is present in native\nsediments underneath the canal and at certain locations in the banks of the canal\nbetween the head of the canal and the Gowanus Expressway, in portions of the upper\nreach of the canal and in the overlying soft sediment primarily in the middle reach of\nthe canal.\nThe NAPL from the three former MGP facilities is, primarily, coal tar waste. Some of\nthis waste was discharged directly into the canal during the periods when the MGPs\nwere operating. This NAPL, being heavier than water, settled to the bottom of the\ncanal, and a portion of it might have been transported within the canal as a result of\ntidal currents and the action of the flushing tunnel when it was operating. Native\nsediments along nearly the entire length of the canal above the Gowanus Expressway\nbecame contaminated with coal tar. In some areas, this NAPL has moved downward\nto substantial depths below the canal and laterally into the banks of the canal.\nAdditional coal tar NAPL can be found in the subsurface soils near the former MGP\nfacilities. This is tar which escaped from the subsurface structures at the former MGP\n21\nfacilities and seeped into the surrounding soils. Very high levels of coal tar\ncontamination have been found at all three of the former MGP facilities. In some\nlocations, the pore spaces of the soils near the former MGP facilities are saturated with\ncoal tar. It is clear that in some cases, this tar is either still mobile or could be\nmobilized in the future by relatively minor subsurface disturbances. PAH and BTEX\ncompounds are major constituents of coal tar.\nIn most areas north of the Gowanus Expressway, NAPL and high-PAH concentrations\nwere found in sediment to the maximum depth of the investigation activities, which was\ntargeted to be six feet below the interface between the soft and native sediment layers.\nDeep borings installed in the canal adjacent to the Public Place former MGP facility by\nNational Grid in 2010 indicate that NAPL contamination extends to a depth in excess of\n50 feet below the sediment surface. Adjacent land-based borings on the former MGP\nfacility contained visible NAPL at depths of more than 100 feet.\nWhile the NAPL from historic MGP operations accounts for the majority of the PAH\nmass and the highest PAH concentrations in canal sediments, PAH concentrations in\nthe top six inches of the sediments (the bioactive zone) in the upper reach of the canal\nare primarily associated with contaminants introduced through more recent CSO\ndischarges. Existing sediments in the canal are covered by newer contaminated CSO\nsediments and, to some extent, solids transported from the harbor through tidal\ntransport or through the flushing tunnel when it is in operation. Thus, generally, surface\nsediments are newer and deeper sediments are older.\nSome ongoing movement of coal tar NAPL into shallow sediments has been\ndocumented. In the vicinity of the Public Place former MGP facility, tar droplets can\noccasionally be seen rising to the water surface in the canal during low tide. It appears\nthat this tar is being transported upward through the sediments by the ebullition of gas\nbubbles generated by microbial decay of organic material in the sediments.\nCombined Sewer Overflows\nThe results for wet weather CSO water samples (i.e., samples collected from the sewer\nsystem during wet weather overflow events) indicate that CSOs containing VOCs,\nPAHs, PCBs, pesticides and metals are discharged to the canal during wet weather\nevents. The wet weather CSO water samples represent actual discharges to the canal.\nSamples were collected from the combined sewer regulators, approximately one block\nfrom the discharge points, to eliminate potential backflow (tidal intrusion) from the\ncanal. Sampling results for residual CSO sediments collected from within sewer pipes\nindicate that, if mobilized during wet weather events, these will discharge VOCs, PAHs,\nPCBs, pesticides and metals to the canal.\n22\nUnpermitted Pipe Outfalls\nAs noted above, more than 250 unpermitted pipe outfalls were identified and inspected\nduring the RI; 25 of these pipe outfalls were observed to be actively discharging during\ndry weather. Effluent from 14 of the 25 active outfalls identified during the RI could not\nbe attributed to tidal drainage (i.e., drainage of seawater that entered the pipe at high\ntide). Samples from 12 of these 14 outfall discharges contained VOCs, PAHs and\nmetals (two of the discharges were not sampled due to low flow rates). Pesticides and\nPCBs were not detected. Contaminant loading from unpermitted outfalls was estimated\nto be very low since observed pipe discharges were intermittent and at very low flow\nrates (estimated to be less than 1 liter per minute). Based on these estimates and\nmeasurements (according to NYCDEP’s 2008 study), these loadings are insignificant\nby comparison to other sources, such as the CSOs and the flushing tunnel.\nSurface Water\nVOCs, SVOCs and metals were detected in surface water samples collected from the\ncanal under wet-weather and dry-weather conditions for the RI. Pesticides and PCBs\nwere not detected in any surface water sample. BTEX compounds were the most\ncommon VOCs detected and PAHs were the most common SVOCs detected.\nConcentrations of contaminants, including benzene and PAHs in the Gowanus Canal\nsurface water samples were significantly higher than their concentrations at the\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference locations during both dry- and wet-\nweather conditions.\nHigh levels of bacteria are also present in the canal as a result of periodic discharges\nfrom the combined sewer outfalls. Although not considered for CERCLA remedy\nselection purposes, risk to child and adult recreational users and workers from CSO-\nrelated pathogen exposure is a significant issue, as was outlined in the draft Gowanus\nCanal Public Health Assessment.\nAmbient Air\nThe sampling results for air samples collected from canoe-level and street-level\nlocations along the length of the canal and from three background locations (two blocks\nwest of the canal) indicate that the types and concentrations of VOCs and PAHs\ndetected in air samples were similar, regardless of sample location. The detected\nconstituents were typical of those found in urban environments and the VOC and PAH\nconcentrations were either within the same order of magnitude (sampling round 1) or\nthe same as those found in urban environments (sampling round 2).\n23\nGroundwater\nGroundwater samples were collected from 44 shallow and 46 intermediate monitoring\nwells. With the exception of PCBs, all classes of contaminants that were sampled for\n(VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs, pesticides and metals) were detected in samples from both the\nshallow and intermediate groundwater throughout the length of the canal (PCBs were\nnot detected in any of the sampled monitoring wells). Chemical concentrations in the\ngroundwater were higher in wells where NAPL saturation was observed in the soil\nborings. VOC concentrations were higher than screening values in approximately 33\npercent of the shallow monitoring wells and 67 percent of the intermediate monitoring\nwells along the canal. Similarly, SVOC concentrations were higher than screening\nvalues in approximately 33 percent of the shallow monitoring wells and in half of the\nintermediate monitoring wells. Pesticides, however, were detected in only one shallow\nmonitoring well and in one intermediate monitoring well and exceeded the screening\nvalue at the intermediate monitoring well location. With regard to metals, all of the\nshallow and intermediate monitoring wells contained at least one metal (arsenic,\nbarium, lead, nickel or sodium) above its screening value.\nFor the shallow groundwater, a number of PAHs (2-methylnaphtalene, acenaphthene,\nacenaphtylene, anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorine, naphthalene, phenanthrene and\npyrene) were found in more than half of the collected shallow groundwater samples\nand 93.2% of all samples contained at least one PAH. The compounds that showed the\nmost excursions of various applicable standards were the VOCs benzene,\nethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene and xylene. The same general pattern is true for the\nintermediate groundwater with 98% of all intermediate groundwater samples containing\nat least one PAH.\nThe EPA analyzed the groundwater data to determine whether contaminated\ngroundwater discharge to the canal could potentially lead to continuing sediment\ncontamination. This evaluation was performed by calculating Equilibrium-Partitioning\nSediment Benchmark Toxic Units (TUs) for PAHs in each groundwater sample\ncollected along the canal during the RI. Briefly, the TUs were calculated by comparing\nPAH concentrations in groundwater samples to their corresponding Final Chronic\nValues (FCV) based on the EPA’s National Water Quality Criteria (EPA, 2003). These\nFCVs represent the concentrations of the PAHs in water that are considered to be\nprotective of the presence of aquatic life.\nEstimates of total PAH mass flux were calculated. The analysis used both the median\nand mean concentrations for each RTA and the RTA-specific groundwater discharge\nrates and pore water concentrations provided by National Grid. The resulting\nestimates of total PAH flux to the canal, which are presented in Table 5, exhibit a wide\nvariation in PAH discharge rates, ranging from 19 to 1,500 kilograms/year. The\nestimate developed using the mean groundwater concentration is significantly higher\n24\nthan the median groundwater concentration and both the median and mean pore water\nconcentrations, but is not considered representative because it is biased by a few high\nvalues. The estimated mass discharge calculated using the median pore water\nconcentration is considered the most representative of the four values. These\nconcentrations represent the equilibrium PAH concentrations in near surface sediment\nassociated pore water throughout the canal and are indicative of what may actually be\nfluxing into the surface water. Further, the data set includes a wide range of pore water\nconcentrations, and has appropriate spatial coverage, including several samples in the\ncentral, most contaminated portion of the canal. Based on these data, the magnitude\nof the groundwater flux of total PAHs to the canal is relatively low compared to other\nsources.\nContaminant Fate and Transport\nThe conceptual site model (CSM)20 for the Gowanus Canal summarizes and integrates\nthe information presented above about historical and ongoing sources of\ncontamination, the nature and extent of contamination, contaminant fate and transport\nmechanisms and risks to humans and wildlife from exposure to contaminated\nsediments in the Gowanus Canal. A schematic representation of the CSM for the\nGowanus Canal is provided in Figure 4. This CSM is used as the basis for developing\nremedial action objectives (RAOs)21 and remedial alternatives for canal sediments.\nThe EPA did not independently develop a hydrodynamic model as part of the RI/FS.\nInstead, the results of hydrodynamic modeling performed by the USACE for the\nGowanus Bay and Canal Ecosystem Restoration Study (i.e., maps showing velocities\nand shear stresses throughout the canal under existing conditions) were considered in\nthe development of the CSM. The model results were used in conjunction with other\ndata-based lines of evidence (e.g., contaminant concentration gradients, bathymetric\nchanges over time, sediment physical characteristics, radioisotope profiles, historical\ndocumentation about siltation in the canal) to develop the CSM. The results of three-\ndimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling recently performed by\nNational Grid were also considered; these results are consistent with the data-based\nCSM developed for the RI/FS. While the CSM developed for the RI/FS is sufficient to\nestablish the basis for a remedial action, additional data collection and modeling will be\nuseful to confirm the CSM and prepare the remedial design.22\n20 A conceptual site model illustrates contaminant sources, release mechanisms, exposure\npathways, migration routes and potential human and ecological receptors.\n21 RAOs, which are developed after site characterization, are specific goals to protect human\nhealth and the environment.\n22 In connection with its CWA compliance, NYCDEP developed a three-dimensional, time-\nvariable, coupled hydrodynamic/water-quality model. Since NYCDEP has declined requests\nto provide its model to the EPA, the EPA has not been able to assess it.\n25\nSediment Transport and Deposition\nMany of the contaminants detected in canal sediments (e.g., SVOCs, PCBs, high\nmolecular weight PAHs and metals) have a low solubility and an affinity for fine-grained\nsediment particles and organic matter. Contaminants with a higher solubility and\nvolatility (i.e., VOCs and some of the low-molecular-weight SVOCs) tend to disperse in\nthe water column. Therefore, the accumulation of soft sediments in the canal over time\nhas resulted in the accumulation of high levels of persistent contaminants. Because of\nlow current velocities and limited tidal exchange with Gowanus Bay, the contaminated\nsediments have accumulated in the canal rather than being flushed out to the bay.\nBathymetric survey data indicate that one to three feet of sediment was deposited in\nthe upper canal between 3rd Street and Sackett Street between 2003 and 2010. The\nupper canal is the reach most affected by the deposition of solids from CSO\ndischarges. Radioisotope analyses of sediment cores from other areas of the canal\n(i.e., south of 3rd Street) indicate net sediment accumulation rates on the order of one\nto two inches/yr (GEI, 2007), although most of the cores that were dated showed\nevidence of disturbances that reduce the accuracy of the age-dating estimates.\nSince many of the contaminants that are present at high levels in the Gowanus Canal\nsoft sediments have an affinity for fine-grained sediment particles and organic matter,\nthe fate and transport of these contaminants are largely controlled by the fate and\ntransport of the sediments. Sediments deposited in Gowanus Canal may be re-\nsuspended by currents, propeller wash, dredging and other disturbances. The canal is\na low-velocity environment, with average current velocities less than 0.5 feet per\nsecond. These current speeds are insufficient to substantially erode sediment deposits.\nCurrents generated by the flushing tunnel apparently erode sediments near the outlet\nof the tunnel, but the sediments are most likely to settle out where the current velocities\ndecrease farther down the canal between Sackett and 3rd Streets.\nSediments in the Gowanus Canal appear to be frequently re-suspended and mixed by\npropeller wash from vessel traffic. The effects of propeller wash are particularly evident\nin the reach between the Gowanus Expressway and 3rd Street, where minimal net\nsediment accumulation was observed between 2003 and 2010. This reach experiences\nfrequent tugboat and barge traffic associated with the concrete plant at the end of 5th\nStreet. Evidence of propeller scour was also seen near the southern end of the\nGowanus Canal (i.e., north of Bryant and 22nd Streets) in the 2010 bathymetric survey.\nSubstantial sediment disturbance also can result from vessel groundings. High\nresolution bathymetric surveys performed by National Grid in 2010 and 2011 indicated\nthat a barge grounding near the mouth of the 4th Street basin in 2011 resulted in the\ndisplacement of up to 10 feet of sediment.\nGiven the low current velocities in the canal, most of the sediments re-suspended by\npropeller wash likely settle out in the same reach of the canal. Finer-grained sediment\n26\nparticles that remain suspended in the water column for a longer period of time may,\nhowever, be transported out of the canal by tidal currents and dispersion. The amount\nof sediment transported out of or into the canal in typical weather conditions or during\nstorm events has not been measured. However, a substantial drop in contaminant\nconcentrations in surface sediments from the middle reach of the canal to the lower\nreach and the additional drop from the lower reach of the canal to the Gowanus Bay\nand Upper New York Bay reference locations indicate that much of the contaminated\nsediment remains within the canal, north of the Gowanus Expressway. Contaminated\nsediments that are transported out of the canal are mixed with and diluted by\nsuspended sediments from New York Harbor.\nContaminated Solids Impacts from Combined Sewer Overflows\nContaminated CSO solids impacts are most apparent in the upper reach of the canal\nbecause the outfall at the head of the canal (RH-034) is the single largest contributor to\nCSO discharges. Solids from CSO discharges are transported down the canal and\ndeposited as the velocity from the CSOs dissipates with increasing distance from the\nhead of the canal. Currents from the flushing tunnel, when operating, may facilitate\ntransport, but also dissipate with increasing distance from the head of the canal. This\nis consistent with NYCDEP’s conclusions in its 2008 WB/WS Plan: “Historical\ndischarges by CSOs and stormwater have impacted almost the entire canal bottom.”\nIn that report, NYCDEP concluded that \"CSOs dominate the loadings of . . . total\nsuspended solids . . . to Gowanus Canal,\" and that discharges from the outfall at the\nhead of the canal (RH-034) \"dominate the CSO impacts throughout the entire Canal.\"\nHazardous substance levels in surface sediments in the upper reach are less\ninfluenced by releases from the former MGP facilities than surface sediments in the\nmiddle reach. The sediments in the upper reach are less susceptible to re-suspension\nby propeller wash from vessel traffic or vessel groundings, due to the low levels of such\ntraffic in the upper reach. As noted previously, bathymetric studies from 2003 to 2010\nindicate that one to three feet of sediment was deposited between 3rd and Sackett\nStreets. These shallow sediments were deposited after the period of greatest industrial\nactivity in the canal and are, therefore, more predominantly influenced by CSO and\nstormwater discharges than by legacy contamination from historical industrial activity.\nOther sources of solids to the upper reach of the Gowanus Canal include inflow from\nButtermilk Channel through the flushing tunnel (when it is operating) and tidal\nadvection/dispersion from Upper New York Bay through Gowanus Bay at the south end\nof the project area (when the flushing tunnel is not operating). A portion of the\nsuspended sediments in these inflows settles in the canal as the current velocities\ndecrease to slack tide.\nThe mass of solids delivered by each source (CSO/stormwater discharges and inflow\n27\nfrom Upper New York Bay) was not quantified in the RI/FS or in the water quality model\ndeveloped by NYCDEP for its CSO control planning, although NYCDEP included\nmodeling of TSS and separated TSS into outfall and background (i.e., Upper New York\nBay) components to distinguish between the heavier, more-settleable solids discharged\nfrom sewers and the lighter, less-settleable solids suspended in receiving waters\n(NYCDEP, 2007).\nThe EPA has concluded that multiple lines of physical and chemical evidence\ndemonstrate that CSO and stormwater solids have a significantly greater influence on\nthe quality of sediments in the 0-2-foot depth interval in the upper reach of the canal\nthan incoming sediments from Upper New York Bay. These lines of evidence include:\n Contaminated CSO solids23 have high TOC content. The TOC content of the\nsurface sediment is about 6 percent. The TOC levels in Upper New York Bay\nsediments are, on average, about 3 percent (EPA, 1998 and the RI report).\nAccordingly, if suspended sediments in tidal inflow or flushing tunnel flows from\nUpper New York Bay were contributing the majority of the deposited mass, the TOC\nof the surface sediment would be closer to 3 percent.\n The concentrations of PAHs, copper and lead in the surface sediment and in the\nCSO solids are similar. The concentrations of these chemicals are much lower in\nthe reference sediments in the harbor; therefore, deposition of suspended\nsediments in harbor water (or from the flushing tunnel which brings in harbor water)\ncould not be the predominant source of PAHs, copper and lead in the canal surface\nsediments.\n Sewage indicators, such as fecal coliform (GEI, 2011a, 2012a and 2012b) and\nsteroids (Kruge et al., 2007), are found consistently in the surface sediment in the\ncanal. The highest concentrations are located in the upper portion of the canal\nwhere most of the CSOs are located.\n The EPA’s bathymetric study shows that most of the accumulation of sediment\ncoincides with the canal location (upper reach) where most of the CSOs are located\nand the highest CSO volumetric discharges take place. It has been reported and\nvisually noted that CSOs discharge heavier mass solids. These heavier solids are\ntypically expected to settle to the bottom of the canal within a short distance from\nthe point of discharge unless high horizontal velocities disperse the solids\ndownstream.\n Overall, the surface sediments in the upper canal have higher sand content and\nlower silt and clay content than the Harbor reference locations. The sediments in\nthe lower canal, closer to the Harbor, have similar silt and clay content to the\nreference stations. This indicates that the upper canal surface sediment is more\ninfluenced by the deposition of contaminated CSO solids than the area near the\n23 Contaminated CSO solids are the particles that are discharged to the canal during overflow\nevents, whereas CSO sediment is the residual material found in the sewer pipes.\n28\nmouth of the canal. This is consistent with NYCDEP’s conclusion that CSOs\npredominately contribute heavy grain sediments, while fine grain sediments are a\nmixture of CSO discharges and flushing tunnel and harbor tidal contributions.\nThe multiple lines of evidence summarized above strongly support the conclusion that\nsurface sediment contaminant concentrations in the upper reach of the canal are\nsignificantly influenced by the accumulation of CSO solids. As a result, the EPA has\nconcluded that the contaminated CSO solids are a source to the canal which must be\ncontrolled as part of this selected remedy. As discussed in further detail below, the\nestimated range of contaminated CSO solids control in the selected remedy\nincorporates an uncertainty factor which will be addressed during the remedial design.\nFurther refinement of the sediment and contaminant mass balance is constrained by\nthe constant variability in inputs, including the frequency, size and nature of storm\nevents and infrastructure changes, such as the flushing tunnel and pump station\nupgrades, planned sewer separation project and on-going development. The EPA’s\nCERCLA remedial design will be informed and refined by the results of additional\nsampling and modeling, as well as by coordination with NYSDEC and NYCDEP as\nthey gather Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) data developed in accordance with\nEPA CSO guidance in advance of the LTCP submittal to address CWA compliance.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Fate and Transport\nNAPL in the canal sediments can be transported upward through the sediments into\nthe water column through several transport mechanisms, including ebullition, seep\nmigration, sheen migration and groundwater advection. Ebullition is the production of\ngas due to anaerobic biological activity in sediment (Viana et al., 2007a).\nMineralization24 of organic matter by bacteria in the sediment generates gases such as\nmethane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide which cause ebullition (Reible, 2004). Ebullition\nis commonly observed in the soft sediments in the Gowanus Canal, which are rich in\norganic matter. The bubbles produced during ebullition tend to accumulate hydrophobic\ncontaminants and colloids, such as NAPL sheen, on their surfaces (Viana et al.,\n2007b). NAPL can then migrate through sediments and be adsorbed onto more newly\ndeposited sediments or out of the sediment and upward through the water column and\nbe deposited on the water surface as a sheen.\nThe EPA performed additional research on the potential for ebullition in the canal (EPA,\n2013). The analysis concluded that ebullition is likely limited to the soft sediment, with\nRTA 1 and RTA 2 having the highest ebullition potential based on several factors:\n RTA 1 and RTA 2 had the highest TOC in the canal. Across all three reaches, the\nTOC in soft sediments was 4.2 to 15 times greater than the TOC in the native\n24 Mineralization is the decomposition or oxidization of the chemical compounds in organic\nmatter into plant-accessible forms.\n29\nsediment.\n Shallower water depths reduce the hydraulic pressure that sequesters ebullition.\n NAPL droplets have been observed attached to gas bubbles rising to the water\nsurface at the Public Place former MGP facility on numerous occasions. This\nprocess appears to reach its maximum in late summer, when the decay of organic\nmatter in the canal sediments would be expected to reach its maximum. Upon\nreaching the surface, some of the NAPL generates a sheen which rapidly spreads\non the water surface. In one extreme case, the entire canal water surface between\nPublic Place and the 9th Street bridge was covered.\nA NAPL seep is defined as a NAPL discharge when one or more of the following occur:\n NAPL is moving under a sustained gradient.\n A source that provides the driving force is located at some distance from the seep.\n A recent or ongoing release is typically associated with the discharge.\n NAPL saturations are above residual levels.\nAlthough NAPL seeps can migrate with groundwater through sediments that are not\nimpacted by NAPL (i.e., where NAPL is not coating the solid particle surfaces and\noccupies the smaller pore spaces), NAPL tends to migrate more readily through\nsediments previously impacted with NAPL (i.e., NAPL is coating the solid particles).\n(Sale, 2011). Data from the former MGP facilities show that NAPL elevations are\nabove the sediment elevation and that NAPL seep migration is occurring.\nAn analysis of NAPL impacts at the interface between native and soft sediments in the\nGowanus Canal suggests that the hydrodynamic force from groundwater discharge is\noccurring at some locations. An analysis presented in the FS report indicates that\nupward groundwater velocities can potentially result in the upward NAPL migration\nunder certain conditions.25 This is essentially because the upward vertical groundwater\nvelocity appears to be sufficient to overcome the downward density and capillary forces\nof the NAPL.\nThe EPA performed additional studies in early 2013 to determine if NAPL in native\nsediment could migrate upward from hydrodynamic force (EPA, 2013). It is concluded\nfrom the studies that low groundwater discharge velocities can mobilize NAPL upward\nin the more impacted areas of the canal.\n“NAPL sheen” is defined as a NAPL discharge when one or more of the following\n25 The general Site conditions were used to approximate the potential for NAPL migration. The\nactual conditions at specific locations can vary substantially. Additional data collection and\nevaluation will be necessary to verify NAPL mobility at specific locations for purposes of\nremedial design.\n30\noccur:\n A very limited amount of oil is discharged as a sheen on the water surface.\n Ephemeral sheen behavior may be observed.\n Former seeps have occurred.\n NAPL saturations are close to or below residual levels.\nNAPL sheens migrate as a result of the difference in the surface tensions that result in\na positive spreading coefficient. In the upland area, NAPL spreads on the surface of\nthe groundwater in the same way as the surface water sheen. In this way, the NAPL\nsheen spontaneously enters water-coated, air-filled pores on the surface of the water\ntable and the NAPL migrates. The sheens may migrate into the canal where the\ngroundwater surface intersects the canal. Sheens can also be transported to the canal\nin street runoff, originating in areas where vehicle maintenance activities are taking\nplace or near petroleum handling facilities where delivery trucks are cleaned.\nDroplets of NAPL can also be transported along the length of the canal by tidal currents\nand redeposited in areas some distance from the points where they originally entered\nthe canal. Some transport of discrete NAPL droplets occurs in the canal, particularly in\nthe vicinity of the Public Place former MGP facility. These droplets can be seen on the\ncanal bottom, and can be moved along the bottom and redeposited by the same\ntransport processes that control movement of solid sediment particles.\nOverall, NAPL seep migration is considered the primary mechanism through which\nNAPL enters the canal from the former MGP facilities. A secondary source of potential\nseeps is NAPL that has migrated into the canal and re-infiltrated into the bank at\ncertain locations other than the original source areas. Once in the sediment, hydraulic\nforces can drive the NAPL from the native sediment upward to the soft sediments. In\nthe soft sediments, the hydraulic force continues, but ebullition increases the mobility of\nNAPL upward into the surface water.\nCURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE LAND AND RESOURCE USES\nLand Use\nThe canal is located in a mixed residential-commercial-industrial area. The waterfront\nproperties abutting the canal are primarily commercial and industrial. Rezoning of\nseveral canal-front parcels in the upper canal to high density residential occurred in\n2009. In March 2013, NYC approved the Lightstone Group’s development plans for\n700 rental units on these parcels. Construction is anticipated to begin in fall 2013.\nNYC has also entered into a public-private partnership called Gowanus Green to\nconstruct 774 units of high density mixed income housing on NYC-owned portion of the\nPublic Place former MGP facility. NYC postponed an area-wide rezoning effort as a\n31\nresult of the NPL nomination. However, further rezoning and land use changes have\ncontinued during the Superfund process. For example, a hardship rezoning was\napproved in February 2013 for a Whole Foods market on two canal-side parcels.\nConstruction is under way, with an anticipated completion in fall 2013. In response to\nthe on-going development pressures, Community Board Six formally requested that\nNYC restart the area-wide re-zoning process.\nThrough Community Board Six, the community has also received a grant from the New\nYork State Department of State’s (DOS’s) Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) Program\nfor a study to promote reuse and redevelopment of under-used properties in two large\nsections along the canal. Governmental participants in the ongoing BOA study include\nNYSDOS, NYSDEC, NYC Department of City Planning, the Mayor’s Office of\nEnvironmental Remediation and the EPA.\nAs a result of development speculation, numerous parcels have been acquired along\nand near the canal for potential residential and commercial uses in anticipation of the\ncleanup and further rezoning. Public use along and on the canal is expected to\nincrease significantly over time due to NYC waterfront zoning requirements which\nmandate public esplanades at redevelopment sites along the canal. Such esplanades\nare under construction or planned at the Whole Foods, Lightstone Group and Gowanus\nGreen projects. In addition, moderate–to--large-scale commercial activities, such as\noutdoor nightclubs and flea markets, have operated or sought permits to operate at\ncanal-side parcels.\nThe canal is regularly used by commercial barges at several facilities along the mid-\nand lower canal. Recreational boaters, primarily, canoers and kayakers, frequent the\ncanal. A public boat launch where canoes are available is located at 2nd Street. This\nboat launch will be incorporated into the Lightstone Group project. The anticipated\nremediation and redevelopment will likely increase recreational boating use. A limited\nnumber of people reside in houseboats on the canal.\nDespite posted warnings, the canal is regularly used for fishing, particularly\nsubsistence fishing by several separate communities with environmental justice\nconcerns surrounding the canal. A NYCDEP survey of residents indicated that fishing\nis the number one canal use by area residents (NYCDEP, 2008).\nGroundwater Use\nThe area is served by municipal water. Local groundwater is not used in NYC as a\nsource for potable public water, therefore, a completed exposure pathway does not\nexist. Additionally, the NYC Department of Mental Health and Hygiene has strict\nregulations regarding the installation of wells or the use of groundwater for any\npurpose.\n32\nSUMMARY OF SITE RISKS\nThe human health risk assessment (HHRA) for the Gowanus Canal evaluated\npotential current and future risks to recreational users, anglers, residents and industrial\nworkers in and near the canal. The HHRA evaluated the potential human risks from\nexposure to surface water, sediment, ambient air and ingestion of fish and shellfish\n(crabs). The Gowanus Canal has no remaining natural wetlands (various small,\nunconnected areas of vegetation and intertidal habitat exist) or natural shoreline (the\nshoreline consists of bulkheads, riprap and piers). The community of potential\necological receptors using the canal includes fish-eating birds; dabbling ducks;\ninvertebrates such as worms, amphipods and mollusks; and crabs and fish. The\npotential ecological risk to these receptors from exposure to surface water and\nsediment in the canal was evaluated in the ecological risk assessment (ERA).\nHuman Health Risk Assessment\nA four-step human health risk assessment process was used for assessing Site-\nrelated cancer risks and noncancer health hazards. The four-step process is\ncomprised of:\nHazard Identification: In this step, the chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) at the\nSite in the various media (sediment, surface water and air) are identified based on\nfactors such as toxicity, fate and transport of the contaminants in the environment,\nconcentrations of the contaminants in specific media and bioaccumulation. The\ncontaminated media, concentrations detected and concentrations utilized to estimate\npotential risk and hazards for the chemicals of concern (COCs) at the Site are\npresented in Table 6.\nExposure Assessment: In this step, the different exposure pathways through which\npeople might be exposed to the COPCs in the various media identified in the previous\nstep are evaluated. Examples of exposure pathways include incidental ingestion of\nand dermal contact with contaminated surface water and sediment. The exposure\npathways that were evaluated are presented in Table 7. Factors relating to the\nexposure assessment include, but are not limited to, the concentrations in specific\nmedia that people might be exposed to and the frequency and duration of that\nexposure. Using these factors, a “reasonable maximum exposure” scenario, which\nportrays the highest level of human exposure that could reasonably be expected to\noccur, is calculated.\nToxicity Assessment: In this step, the types of adverse health effects associated with\nchemical exposures and the relationship between magnitude of exposure and severity\nof adverse effects are determined. Potential health effects are chemical-specific and\nmay include the risk of developing cancer over a lifetime or other noncancer health\n33\nhazards, such as changes in the normal functions of organs within the body (e.g.,\nchanges in the effectiveness of the immune system). Some chemicals are capable of\ncausing both cancer and noncancer health hazards. The toxicity values that were\nused to evaluate noncancer health hazards are presented in Table 8 and the toxicity\nvalues that were used to evaluate cancer risk are presented in Table 9.\nRisk Characterization: This step summarizes and combines outputs of the exposure\nand toxicity assessments to provide a quantitative assessment of Site risks for all\nCOPCs. Exposures are evaluated based on the potential risk of developing cancer\nand the potential for noncancer health hazards. The likelihood of an individual\ndeveloping cancer is expressed as a probability. For example, a 10-4 cancer risk\nmeans a “one-in-ten-thousand excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR)”; or one additional\ncancer may be seen in a population of 10,000 people as a result of exposure to Site\ncontaminants under the conditions identified in the Exposure Assessment. Current\nSuperfund regulations for exposures identify the range for determining whether\nremedial action is necessary as an ELCR of 10-4 to 10-6, corresponding to a one-in-\nten-thousand to a one-in-a-million excess cancer risk. For noncancer health effects, a\n“hazard index” (HI) is calculated. The key concept for a noncancer HI is that a\nthreshold exists below which noncancer health hazards are not expected to occur (an\nHI less than 1 would indicate the threshold is not exceeded and a noncancer health\nhazard is not expected). These acceptable risk levels are defined in the NCP at 40\nCFR 300.430(e)(2)(I)(A). Chemicals that contribute to a cancer risk that exceeds 10-4\nor an HI to a specific target that exceeds 1 are typically those that will require\nremedial action at the Site.\nThe HHRA was conducted to evaluate the potential human health risks associated\nwith direct contact (incidental ingestion and dermal contact) with surface sediment and\nsurface water in the Gowanus Canal, ingestion of fish and crabs, direct contact\n(incidental ingestion and dermal contact) with sediment and surface water that overtop\nthe canal during extreme tidal or storm surge conditions, and inhalation of volatile\nemissions from the canal into the ambient air near the canal.\nFor an adult, an adolescent and a child using the canal for recreational purposes, the\nrisks associated with exposure to surface water and surface sediment (from exposed\nand near-shore locations) in the canal and from ambient air at canal level while\nswimming, boating, fishing or crabbing were evaluated. The HHRA assumed that\nrecreational use/swimming in the canal would occur at frequencies, durations and\nexposures that are typical of most water bodies, even though the current actual use of\nthe canal is likely lower given its current nature. The total reasonable maximum\nexposure (RME) noncarcinogenic hazard associated with exposure to surface water\nand sediment for all recreational users was within the EPA’s acceptable risk levels\n(Table 10). However, exposure to surface water and sediment by recreating adults (3\nx 10-4), adolescents (2 x 10-4) and children (8 x 10-4), and lifetime recreational users\n34\n(recreational users throughout their life as child, adolescent and adult; 1 x 10-3) may\nresult in a carcinogenic risk above the EPA’s target risk range (Table 11). These risks\nare associated primarily with exposure to carcinogenic PAHs in the surface water and\nthe surface sediment.\nThe risks associated with exposure to surface water and surface sediment from canal\noverflow and ambient air at street level were evaluated for residential adults and\nchildren and for industrial workers. RME noncarcinogenic hazards and carcinogenic\nrisks associated with exposure to these media by the industrial worker are within\nacceptable levels. Exposure to surface sediment from canal overflow was above the\nEPA’s target risk range (2.0 x 10-4) for the lifetime resident (resident exposed during\nfull life during childhood, adolescence and adulthood).\nAlthough not considered for CERCLA remedy selection purposes, a screening level\nrisk assessment for CSO pathogens that was performed by National Grid found\nsignificant risk to child and adult recreational users and workers from CSO-related\npathogen exposure.\nExposure to ambient air at street level was within acceptable levels. The RME\ncarcinogenic risk for the adult/child resident exceeding acceptable levels is associated\nwith carcinogenic PAHs in sediment (with a smaller contribution from surface water).\nRisks associated with ingesting fish and crabs from the Gowanus Canal were\nevaluated for adult, adolescent and child subsistence and recreational anglers.26 The\nRME total noncarcinogenic hazards and/or carcinogenic risks for all receptors\nexceeded the EPA’s acceptable levels as shown in Tables 10 and 11. Table 12\ncompares the risks associated with fish ingestion for recreational anglers and\nsubsistence fishermen. The noncarcinogenic hazards and carcinogenic risks are\nassociated with PCBs in fish and crabs. Because PAHs normally metabolize quickly in\nfish, the fish tissue samples were not analyzed for PAHs. To assess whether the\ncanal’s high levels of PAHs pose a risk in a scenario where PAHs were not\nmetabolized before consumption, PAHs in fish tissue were estimated assuming that\nfish tissue concentrations of PAHs are similar to the concentrations of PAHs in crab\ntissue. The resulting estimated carcinogenic risks from ingestion of PAHs in fish were\nbelow the EPA’s acceptable risk range. The concentrations of PCBs in the canal fish\nand crab samples were higher than the PCB concentrations in the reference area\nsamples collected from Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay. However, the PCB\nconcentrations in the reference samples would also result in noncarcinogenic hazards\nand carcinogenic risks above the EPA acceptable risk range, although lower than in\n26 The HHRA assumed fishing/crabbing and ingestion of the fish/crab from the canal at typical\nrecreational angler fish/crab consumption rates. The FS report addendum provided a\nsupplemental evaluation of subsistence fishing.\n35\nsamples from the canal.\nEcological Risk Assessment\nThe overall ERA for the Site consisted of a combined screening level ecological risk\nassessment (SLERA) and baseline ecological risk assessment (BERA) performed in\naccordance with the EPA’s (1997) Ecological Risk Assessment Guidance for\nSuperfund and its updates. The survival and reproduction of the following receptor\ngroups were selected for evaluation:\n Benthic (sediment)-dwelling macroinvertebrate communities.\n Water-column-dwelling aquatic life communities.\n Avian wildlife (aquatic herbivores, aquatic omnivores and aquatic piscivores).\nThe following summarizes the risk analysis and results for each receptor group based\non data reported in the BERA.\nRisks to benthic macroinvertebrate communities were evaluated primarily through the\nuse of laboratory-based sediment bioassays (i.e., toxicity tests), which were conducted\nwith two sediment-dwelling invertebrates (amphipods and polychaetes) and through the\ncomparison of sediment chemical concentrations to literature-based screening\nbenchmarks. The analyses indicate the following:\n Sediment bioassays indicate a Site-related potential for adverse effects to benthic\ncommunities from chemicals in sediment, with the greatest potential for adverse\neffects occurring in the central portion of the canal, where contaminant levels are\nhighest. The bioassay results also indicate the potential for less severe, but Site-\nrelated adverse effects to the benthic community at several other locations\nscattered throughout the canal.\n Chemical analysis indicates the presence of organic chemicals (primarily, PAHs\nand PCBs) and metals in sediment at concentrations that are likely to be causing\nthe adverse effects observed in the sediment bioassays. The highest\nconcentrations of those chemicals were detected primarily in the central portion of\nthe canal, which coincides with the locations where the most severe effects to the\nsediment bioassay organisms were also observed.\n PAHs were consistently detected in sediment at the highest concentrations relative\nto their ecological screening benchmarks and are considered to represent the\ngreatest Site-related risk to the benthic community. Other chemicals, most notably\nPCBs and seven metals (barium, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and\nsilver), were also detected at concentrations above their ecological screening\nbenchmarks and at concentrations above those detected in reference area\nsediments and are also considered to represent a potential Site-related risk to the\nbenthic community.\n36\nRisks to water-column-dwelling aquatic life communities were evaluated primarily\nthrough the comparison of surface water chemical concentrations to literature-based\nscreening benchmarks. The surface water was sampled during both dry and wet (i.e.,\nwhile CSO outfalls were discharging) periods. Chemical concentrations in surface\nwater indicate very little Site-related potential for adverse effects to water-column-\ndwelling aquatic life.\nRisks to avian aquatic wildlife were evaluated by modeling the potential exposure of\nthese receptors to chemicals ingested in food items including prey (e.g., fish and crabs)\nand through the incidental ingestion of sediment. The analyses indicate the following:\n There is a potential risk to aquatic herbivores (represented by black duck) from\nexposure to PAHs. PAHs were detected on-Site (in sediments) at concentrations\nabove those detected in reference area locations and represent a Site-related risk\nto aquatic herbivores.\n There is a potential risk to avian omnivores (represented by heron) from exposure\nto mercury and selenium. Mercury was the only metal that was frequently detected\nboth in fish and crab tissues at elevated concentrations and that was also detected\nin canal sediments at a concentration above those detected in reference area\nlocations. Although the BERA concluded that mercury poses a Site-related risk to\nomnivorous birds, additional analysis of the sediment and tissue data collected for\nthe RI indicates that mercury levels in the Gowanus Canal are similar to those in the\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference areas. Therefore, risks to avian\nomnivores was dropped from further consideration.\n There is no potential unacceptable risk to avian piscivores, such as the double-\ncrested cormorant, from the ingestion of fish in the canal.\n As indicated in the human health section, PAHs were not analyzed in fish tissue.\nUsing an assumption that fish tissue concentrations of PAHs are similar to the\nconcentrations of PAHs in crab tissue, food web modeling shows no unacceptable\nrisk from PAHs to avian wildlife from the consumption of fish.\nUncertainties\nThe procedures and inputs used to assess risks in this evaluation, as in all such\nassessments, are subject to certain uncertainties for both the HHRA and the BERA.\nHuman Health Risk Assessment Uncertainties: The sampling conducted along the\ncanal for use in the HHRA focused on areas where contact with the canal is most likely\nto occur (shallow and exposed sediment and surface water and air samples collected\nfrom similar locations) to estimate the most realistic exposure and risk to humans.\nAdditional surface water and surface sediment samples were collected from locations\nwhere historic operations and discharges to the canal have most likely occurred. Only\nthe surface sediment samples from the exposed and shallow areas were used to\nevaluate the recreational exposure risks, as this is the sediment that these receptors\n37\nare most likely to contact. All of the surface water samples were included in the\nrecreational scenario evaluations, since the receptors could be exposed to the water\nthroughout the canal while boating. All of the surface water and surface sediment\nsamples were used to evaluate risks to the residential and industrial worker receptors\nassociated with exposure to canal overflow water and sediment. Therefore, the\navailable data were evaluated in the HHRA in data groupings for each receptor group\nto estimate the more likely reasonable maximum exposures and risks for each\nreceptor. The uncertainty associated with the data analysis is minimal. All of the data\nwere validated prior to being used in the HHRA, and a data quality evaluation was\nperformed on all analytical data evaluated in the HHRA.\nA few constituents (mainly pesticides) were not detected in any of the fish or crab\ntissue samples but had detection limits above the human health risk-based screening\nlevel. This may result in slightly underestimating the risk associated with ingestion of\nfish and crab. However, it should be noted that risks above acceptable levels were\nidentified for the fish and/or crab tissue and risks were primarily associated with the\nPCBs detected in the fish and crab tissue. The pesticides, when they were detected in\nthe fish and crab tissue, did not contribute significantly to the risk. A comparison of data\ncollected from the canal to data collected from the reference locations was not used to\nidentify the COPCs for the canal media. This may result in including COPCs related to\nbackground conditions in the risk estimates. All of the canal data were screened\nagainst residential screening levels to select the COPCs. The use of residential\nscreening levels is conservative, as not all the scenarios evaluated in the HHRA are\nresidential (i.e., the industrial worker scenario). This may result in including COPCs\nwith small contributions to overall risk estimates.\nThe exposure factors used for quantifying exposure were conservative and reflect\nupperbound assumptions (RMEs). The reliability of the values chosen for the exposure\nfactors also contributes substantially to the uncertainty of the resulting risk estimates.\nThe most conservative recreational scenario (swimming) was used to evaluate\npotential exposure and risks for recreating adults, adolescents and children. Based on\nthe current conditions of the canal, it is likely that this is an overestimate of actual\nexposure to recreational receptors. Although possible, it is not likely that a current\nrecreational receptor would swim in the canal for 26 days per year for 2.6 hours per\nday. For the purposes of the risk assessment, the angler population was defined as\nthose individuals who consume self-caught fish from the Gowanus Canal at least once\nper year, in the absence of a fishing ban or fish consumption advisories. While the\nrisks associated with subsistence fishing would be expected to be higher than for a\nrecreational angler, since actual consumption rates for subsistence fisherman were\nunknown, they had to be estimated. Sources of uncertainty in the PCB concentrations\nin fish used in the assessment include the fact that concentrations were averaged over\nlocation and weighted by species. The weighting of species intake in order to derive an\naverage exposure point concentration in fish is a source of uncertainty because there\n38\nare limited Site-specific data available to estimate the species ingestion preferences\n(e.g., weighting factors). Cancer risks and noncancer health hazards were not\nspecifically quantified for subsistence anglers or other subpopulations of anglers who\nmay be highly exposed. There is some degree of uncertainty as to whether these\nsubpopulations have been adequately addressed in the risk assessment. Reported\ncooking losses vary considerably among numerous studies. However, little information\nis available to quantify personal preferences among anglers for various preparation and\ncooking methods and other related habits (such as consumption of pan drippings). The\nassumption that there is no loss of PCBs during cooking or preparation, used in the\nRME cancer risk and noncarcinogenic hazard calculations is conservative and could\noverestimate cancer risks and noncarcinogenic hazards, depending on how the fish are\nprepared. The sediment/skin adherence factor represents the amount of sediment that\nadheres to skin and is available for dermal exposure. Because this value is likely to\nvary based on one’s activity, the values used for this parameter, which are estimates\nfrom single activities, are somewhat uncertain.\nFor dermal contact with canal sediments, published adherence factors for adults\ngathering reeds and for children playing in wet soils were used as a surrogate for\nrecreational children and adults and children. Although it is somewhat uncertain\nwhether these scenarios are representative of contact with canal sediments, they\nappear to be a reasonable use of available data.\nCommercial PCB mixtures tested in laboratory animals were not subject to prior\nselective retention of persistent congeners through the food chain, so there is a\npotential that carcinogenic risks and noncarcinogenic hazards have been\nunderestimated. However, since the cancer slope factors (CSF) are based on animal\nexposures to a group of PCB mixtures (i.e., Aroclor 1260, 1254, 1242 and 1016) that\ncontain overlapping groups of congeners spanning the range of congeners most often\nfound in environmental mixtures, this source of potential uncertainty is unlikely to have\na significant impact. The fact that any previous exposures (either background or past\nconsumption of contaminated fish) may still be reflected in an individual's body burden\ntoday is an additional source of uncertainty, and may result in an underestimate of\nnoncarcinogenic health hazards. The risk assessment assumed that people would\nconsume both the combined muscle (edible portion) and hepatopancreas from blue\ncrab. This may result in an overestimation of risk, as many crabbers do not consume\nthe hepatopancreas, and some chemicals, such as PCBs and mercury, accumulate in\nthe hepatopancreas. However, the hepatopancreas is small compared to the edible\nportion of the fish and, therefore, although concentrations may be higher in the\nhepatopancreas, it contributes a small amount of the total amount of crab consumed by\nthe receptor. Therefore, it would not significantly change the total amount of\ncontaminants consumed.\n39\nDioxin-like PCB toxicity equivalent (TEQ) concentrations, non-dioxin-like PCB\nconcentrations and total PCB concentrations were calculated for each sample using\ndetected PCB congeners only. In general, if the nondetected dioxin congeners were\nincluded in the sample concentration calculations, the non-dioxin-like PCB\nconcentrations and the total PCB concentrations would be similar to those used in the\nrisk assessment and the resulting risks would not differ significantly. The dioxin-like\nPCB TEQ concentrations would not always be similar, since if the most toxic congener\n(3,3’,4,4’,5-pentachlorobipheny) was not detected in a sample, inclusion of this\ncongener at the detection limit times the toxicity equivalency factor (TEF) would\ncontribute significantly to the dioxin-like PCB TEQ, even if it was not detected.\nTherefore, this may result in an underestimation of actual risk if this congener was\npresent in the sample at a concentration below the reporting limit. However, when this\ncongener was detected in a sample, it was generally flagged as detected below the\nreporting limit, so it is unlikely that it would be present in the samples at concentrations\nsimilar to reporting limits, and it would likely be present at much lower concentrations\nand not contribute significantly to the dioxin-like PCB TEQ concentration for the\nsample. Additionally, congeners that were detected in a laboratory or field blank at a\nconcentration similar to that in the sample were not included in the concentration\ncalculation. There were a number of such samples, which may result in an\nunderestimation of risk if these congeners are present in the samples at a\nconcentration below the blank contamination level. However, the concentrations in\nthese samples were generally below the reporting limits.\nThere are inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with estimating health risks\non the basis of fish and crab consumption that should be considered when interpreting\nthe results of the HHRA. Factors contributing to these uncertainties include game fish\nand blue crab ranges are not limited to the canal, but reflect cumulative uptake from all\nareas they traverse. Blue crab and some of the game fish species kept by anglers have\nrelatively large home ranges, and those caught within the canal are likely, at least in\npart, to have inhabited areas outside the canal and therefore to have been potentially\nexposed to contaminants not related to the canal. However, differences between canal\nand reference concentrations of PCBs in fish and crab tissue and sediment were\nidentified, with canal media having higher concentrations. Assumptions regarding\nfishing/crabbing frequency and fish/crab consumption rates are variable and affect the\nestimates of exposure and associated risk.\nThere is uncertainty associated with the noncarcinogenic toxicity factors. The EPA\napplies several uncertainty factors (UFs) to extrapolate doses from animal studies to\nhumans. The UFs for the COPCs range from 1 to 3,000. Therefore, there is a high\ndegree of uncertainty in the noncarcinogenic toxicity criteria based on the available\nscientific data. The noncarcinogenic toxicity factors used in the HHRA are expected to\nbe overestimates of actual toxicity.\n40\nCSFs and inhalation unit risk factors developed by the EPA represent upper-bound\nestimates. Carcinogenic risks generated in this assessment should be regarded as an\nupper-bound estimate on the potential carcinogenic risks. The true excess lifetime\ncancer risk is likely to be less than the predicted value. Use of provisional or withdrawn\ntoxicity factors increases the uncertainty of the quantitative hazard and risk estimates.\nProvisional toxicity values were used in the HHRA to provide a quantitative estimate\nrather than a merely qualitative risk discussion. The TEFs used to adjust the\nconcentrations of the dioxin-like PCB congeners to TEQ of dioxin for the sediment and\nfish/crab also results in uncertainty in the risk assessment. In particular, although the\nTEF scheme and TEQ methodology is intended primarily for estimating exposure and\nrisk through ingestion, it was also used to estimate exposure and risk through dermal\ncontact.\nAdditionally, not using the dioxin-like PCB congener TEQ to evaluate noncarcinogenic\nrisks may underestimate the noncarcinogenic hazard associated with exposure to the\nPCBs. However, there is a lot of uncertainty with use of this process, and even more\nuncertainty with use of it for noncarcinogenic hazards since the TEFs are based on the\nrelationship of the PCB congeners to the carcinogenic risks associated with dioxin.\nAlthough, there is a large degree of uncertainty associated with use of this method for\nnoncarcinogenic-hazard evaluation, noncarcinogenic hazards were estimated as part\nof the uncertainty evaluation. Noncarcinogenic hazards were calculated for the dioxin-\nlike PCB TEQ concentrations for sediment and fish/crab using the reference dose\n(RfD) for 2,3,7,8-TCDD from the 1998 dioxin Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry (ATSDR) toxicity profile. It should be noted that use of this RfD in\nitself presents a source of uncertainty, as the ATSDR toxicity profiles are a Tier 3\nsource of toxicity information.27 Noncarcinogenic hazards were calculated for the non-\ndioxin-like PCB concentrations using the RfD for Aroclor 1254. The sum of the\nnoncarcinogenic hazards associated with the dioxin-like PCB TEQ concentrations and\nthe non-dioxin-like PCB concentrations for all receptors for sediment and fish/crab are\nbelow 1 and in most cases are less than the noncarcinogenic hazards associated with\nthe total PCB concentration, which were estimated using the total PCB concentrations\nand the RfD for Aroclor 1254. Therefore, evaluation of the noncarcinogenic hazards for\nthe dioxin-like PCB TEQ concentrations does not change the conclusions of the HHRA.\nEcological Risk Assessment Uncertainties: Uncertainties are present in all ERAs\nbecause of the limitations in the available data and the need to make certain\nassumptions and extrapolations based upon the collected information. In addition, the\n27 OSWER Directive 9285.7-53, Human Health Toxicity Values in Superfund Risk\nAssessments, December 5, 2003, recommends a hierarchy of toxicological sources of\ninformation for which risk assessors initially consider for site-specific risk assessments: Tier\n1, EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System; Tier 2, EPA’s Provisional Peer Reviewed\nToxicity Values and Tier 3, additional EPA and non-EPA sources of toxicity information with\npriority given to those sources of information that are the most current.\n41\nuse of various models (for example, uptake and food web exposure models) introduce\nsome associated uncertainty depending on how well the model reflects actual\nconditions. The primary uncertainties in the BERA for the Gowanus Canal are\nassociated with the media sampled and the assumptions used in the risk analysis.\nInformation on the eco-toxicological effects of constituent interactions is generally\nlacking, which requires (as is standard for ERAs, in general) that the constituents be\ncompared individually to screening values. This could result in an underestimation of\nrisk (if there are additive or synergistic effects among constituents) or an\noverestimation of risks (if there are antagonistic effects among constituents). For\nsediment and tissue, total PCB, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and PAH\nconcentrations were calculated and evaluated instead of addressing the individual\ncompounds from these groups. In some cases, the detection limit for some non-\ndetected chemicals exceeded applicable risk thresholds. The potential for risks\nassociated with these chemicals cannot be fully evaluated and the risks associated\nwith these chemicals may be underestimated.\nThere is some uncertainty as to whether chemical concentrations in fish and crab\ntissues can be attributed to the Gowanus Canal. The blue crabs and many of the fish\nspecies that were sampled represent transient populations that are only seasonally\npresent in the canal. The body burden of these species is, therefore, likely to reflect\nchemical concentrations accumulated both from the Gowanus Canal and other\nlocations.\nUncertainties related to the risk analysis include assumptions associated with\nmodeling. Constituent concentrations in aquatic food items (e.g., aquatic plants) were\nestimated by multiplying measured sediment concentrations by bioconcentration\nfactors (BCFs) and were not directly measured in actual tissue (food). Therefore, the\nuse of generic, literature-derived BCFs introduces some uncertainty into the resulting\nestimates. There is also some uncertainty associated with the receptors selected for\nthe food web exposure assessment. Due to the urbanized setting and structure of the\ncanal and surrounding area, only a limited number of upper trophic level receptors are\nexpected to utilize this aquatic habitat. Therefore, it was assumed that the species\nmost representative of the range of potential feeding groups using the canal included\nthe green heron (omnivore), double-crested cormorant (piscivore) and black duck\n(herbivore). It was assumed that higher trophic level receptors received 100 percent of\ntheir dose from the Site. Assuming 100 percent of food and potential exposure is\nderived from the canal in the BERA is likely to overestimate actual risk. Data on the\ntoxicity of some constituents to the upper trophic level receptor species were sparse or\nlacking, requiring the extrapolation of data from other wildlife species or from laboratory\nstudies with non-wildlife species. Extrapolating is a typical limitation for ERAs because\nso few wildlife species have been tested directly for most constituents. The\nuncertainties associated with toxicity extrapolation were minimized by selecting the\nmost appropriate test species for which suitable toxicity data were available. The\n42\nfactors considered in selecting a test species to represent a receptor species included\ntaxonomic relatedness, trophic level, foraging method and similarity of diet.\nThis BERA considered multiple lines of evidence when evaluating the potential for\nadverse effects to the assessment endpoints that were evaluated. For example, risks to\nthe benthic-dwelling community were evaluated using the results of two sediment\nbioassays along with chemical analytical data. Although the use of multiple lines of\nevidence does not eliminate the uncertainties inherent to the evaluation of ecological\nrisk, it helps to substantiate the general outcomes and conclusions of the BERA.\nGeneral agreement in the different lines of evidence evaluated for each of the\necological receptors increases the level of confidence in the final conclusions made in\nthe BERA.\nSummary of Human Health and Ecological Risks\nThe HHRA indicated completed human risk exposure pathways with unacceptable risk\nlevels for surface water/sediment contact and fish consumption.\nHuman exposure to hazardous substances in surface water and surface sediment by\nrecreating adults, adolescents and children may result in carcinogenic risks above the\nEPA’s target risk range. These risks are associated primarily with exposure to\ncarcinogenic PAHs in the surface water and the surface sediment. The total\nnoncarcinogenic hazard for this pathway was within or below the EPA’s acceptable risk\nlevels.\nHuman exposure to surface water and surface sediment from canal overflow by\nresidential adults and children may result in carcinogenic risks above the EPA’s target\nrisk range. The RME carcinogenic risk for the adult/child resident is associated with\nPAHs in sediment (with a smaller contribution from surface water).\nThe RME total noncarcinogenic hazards and/or carcinogenic risks for angler adult,\nadolescent and child receptors exceed the EPA’s target risk range. The\nnoncarcinogenic hazards and carcinogenic risks are associated with PCBs in fish and\ncrab. The concentrations of PCBs in canal fish and crab samples were higher than the\nPCB concentrations in the reference area samples collected from Gowanus Bay and\nUpper New York Bay.28 The HHRA showed that risk for airborne exposure from the\ncanal was within the acceptable range.\nAlthough not considered for CERCLA remedy selection purposes, a screening level\nrisk assessment for CSO pathogens that was performed by National Grid found\nsignificant risk to child and adult recreational users and workers from CSO-related\n28 As was noted previously, the PCB concentrations in the reference samples also result in\nnoncarcinogenic hazards and carcinogenic risks above the EPA’s target risk range.\n43\npathogen exposure.29 By reducing CSO discharges, the selected CERCLA remedy will\nproduce the tangential benefit of reducing pathogen exposure levels.\nThe key results of the BERA indicated that PAHs, PCBs and metals in the sediment\nare toxic to benthic organisms. PAHs represent the greatest Site-related risk to the\nbenthic community. PCBs and seven metals (barium, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury,\nnickel and silver) were also detected at concentrations that are associated with\npotentially unacceptable risk and are significantly higher than those detected in\nreference area sediments. The observed toxicity in laboratory tests could have resulted\nfrom the effects of one or a combination of these contaminants. The toxicity test results\ncannot be used to distinguish which contaminants were causing the effects, although\nthe results for simultaneously extracted metals/acid volatile sulfide (SEM/AVS)\nanalyses presented in the BERA indicate that the bioavailability of metals is low; thus, it\nis likely that PAHs caused a significant portion of the observed toxicity in laboratory\ntests. However, potential Site-related risk to the benthic community from metals cannot\nbe dismissed. PAHs were found to be a potential risk to aquatic herbivores\n(represented by the black duck) and mercury was found to be a potential risk to avian\nomnivores (represented by the heron).\nBasis for Action\nBased upon the quantitative human-health risk assessment and ecological evaluation,\nthe EPA has determined that actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances\nfrom the Site, if not addressed by the response action selected in this ROD, may\npresent a current or potential threat to human health and the environment.\nREMEDIAL ACTION OBJECTIVES\nAs was noted above, RAOs are specific goals to protect human health and the\nenvironment. These objectives are based on available information and standards,\nsuch as applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs), to-be-\nconsidered guidance, Site-specific risk-based levels and background (i.e., reference\narea) concentrations.\nThe following RAOs were established for the Site:\n Reduce the cancer risk to human health from the incidental ingestion of and dermal\ncontact with PAHs in sediment during recreational use of the canal or from\n29 Elevated HIs calculated for pathogens in National Grid’s HHRA indicate an unacceptable risk\nof gastroenteritis from recreational contact with canal surface water, including light use\ncontact. Therefore, the HHRA identified a significant risk to a child and adult recreational\nvisitor from exposure to pathogens in canal surface water. See GEI, 2012a.\n44\nexposure to canal overflow to levels that are within or below the EPA’s excess\nlifetime cancer risk range of 10-6 to 10-4.\n Reduce the contribution of PCBs from the Gowanus Canal to fish and shellfish by\nreducing the concentrations of PCBs in Gowanus Canal sediment to levels that are\nwithin the range of Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference\nconcentrations.\n Reduce the risks to benthic organisms in the canal from direct contact with PAHs,\nPCBs and metals in the sediments by reducing sediment toxicity to levels that are\ncomparable to reference conditions in Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay;\n Reduce the risk to herbivorous birds from dietary exposure to PAHs.\n Eliminate the migration of NAPL into the canal so as to minimize NAPL serving as a\nsource of contaminants, primarily PAHs, to the canal.\nPreliminary Remediation Goals\nBecause there are no promulgated standards or criteria that apply to the cleanup of\ncontaminated sediments in New York,30 Site-specific, preliminary remediation goals\n(PRGs) for sediments in the Gowanus Canal were developed. PRGs are used to define\nthe extent of cleanup needed to achieve the RAOs. A “clean” surface will be\nestablished at the bottom of the Gowanus Canal at the end of remedy construction.\nThe PRGs will be used as performance targets for this “clean” surface.\nIt should be noted that for the following reasons, the PRGs that are being presented\nare unique to the Gowanus Canal. The canal, especially the upper portion, is a water\nbody contained in a constructed confined space of relatively regular geometry and\nrelatively shallow depth. The canal receives surface water and suspended sediment\nfrom New York Harbor through tidal exchanges from the south end of the canal and\nthrough flushing tunnel flow at the northern end.31 Deposition of solids in the canal\nfrom the harbor and direct stormwater runoff from exposed soil, historic fill and rooftops\nwill constitute the background level of contamination that should be within or slightly\nabove the range of contaminant concentrations at the reference harbor sampling\nstations. As was noted above, the range of PAH concentrations in samples from the\n30 New York’s Technical Guidance for Screening Contaminated Sediments (NYSDEC, 1999)\nstates the following: “Sediments with contaminant concentrations that exceed the criteria\nlisted in this document are considered to be contaminated and potentially causing harmful\nimpacts to marine and aquatic ecosystems. These criteria do not necessarily represent the\nfinal concentrations that must be achieved through sediment remediation. Comprehensive\nsediment testing and risk management are necessary to establish when remediation is\nappropriate and what final contaminant concentrations the sediment remediation efforts\nshould achieve.”\n31 The flushing tunnel connects the head of the canal with Buttermilk Channel in Upper New\nYork Bay.\n45\nharbor reference stations collected during the RI is 1 to 14 mg/kg. The post-\nremediation level of contamination that would be expected in the Gowanus Canal after\nall of the major canal-related sources of contamination have been reduced or controlled\nis likely to be at the upper end of the range because of ongoing contributions from\nuncontrolled surface water runoff and stormwater discharges. Data recently collected\nfrom candidate reference areas for the Newtown Creek Superfund site RI indicate that\nPAH concentrations in enclosed and semi-enclosed industrial embayments without\nCSOs are comparable to the reference area concentrations measured in the Gowanus\nCanal RI.\nHuman Health\nRisk-based human health PRGs were developed to address the identified Site risk\nusing information developed from the HHRA. PRGs were developed for six\ncarcinogenic PAHs for exposure to near-shore surface sediment during recreational\nuse of the canal by adults, adolescents and children. PRGs were not included for\nsurface water because the concentrations of carcinogenic PAHs in canal surface water\nare not significantly different than concentrations in the Gowanus Bay and Upper New\nYork Bay reference area. PRGs were calculated based on the Site-specific exposure\ndata presented in the HHRA. The ratio between the target risk and the calculated risk\nwas determined for each PAH and then the ratio was multiplied by the exposure point\nconcentration from the HHRA to calculate the PRG. A 10-5 target risk level was used\nfor each individual PAH so that the cumulative risk from exposure to all carcinogenic\nPAHs would not exceed 10-4, which is the upper bound of the EPA’s acceptable risk\nrange. Additional PRGs were developed based on a cumulative cancer risk of 10-6,\nwhich is the lower bound of the EPA’s acceptable risk range. The PRGs for the\nrecreational use scenario for sediment and surface water are presented in Table 13.\nPRGs were not developed to address potential risk from exposure to sediment\ndeposited adjacent to the canal after overflow events because sediment remediation\nbased on the recreational use scenario would also address potential risks from canal\noverflow.\nThe HHRA results indicated potentially unacceptable risk from the consumption of\nPCB-contaminated fish and crabs from the Gowanus Canal. However, game fish and\nblue crabs do not forage solely in the canal and the PCB concentrations in their tissues\nreflect cumulative uptake from all of the areas that they inhabit. Therefore, the objective\nis to reduce the contribution of PCBs from the Gowanus Canal to fish and crab tissue\nby reducing the concentrations of PCBs in Gowanus Canal sediments to levels that are\nwithin the range of Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference concentrations.\nThe maximum concentration in reference area surface sediment was selected as the\nPRG (see Table 13).\n46\nEcological\nPRGs were developed for the protection of benthic (sediment-dwelling) organisms and\nherbivorous birds. The PRGs and their basis are presented below.\nProtection of the Benthic Community\nPRGs for the protection of benthic organisms were derived from a graphical analysis\nbased on the Site-specific toxicity test and co-located sediment chemistry data\ncollected for the RI. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and metals (barium, cadmium,\ncopper, lead, mercury, nickel and silver) were greater than screening values in many\nsamples as shown in Table 14. The observed toxicity in laboratory tests could have\nresulted from the effects of one or a combination of these contaminants. The toxicity\ntest results cannot be used to distinguish which contaminants were causing the effects,\nalthough the results for SEM/AVS analyses presented in the BERA (EPA, 2011a)\nindicate that the bioavailability of metals is low; thus, it is likely that PAHs caused a\nsignificant portion of the observed toxicity in laboratory tests. Therefore, target areas\nfor remediation were developed based on PRGs for total PAHs and then checked to\nverify that the potential for adverse effects from exposure to PCBs and metals were\nalso addressed.\nSediment toxicity data are available for two test species: a polychaete (Nereis virens)\nand an amphipod (Leptocheirus plumulosus). Survival and growth of the polychaete\nand survival, growth and reproduction of the amphipod were measured in sediment\nsamples from 17 locations, five of which represented Gowanus Bay and Upper New\nYork Bay reference conditions. Laboratory control sediment was also used in each test.\nBecause greater responses were seen in the amphipod tests, only those results were\nused to derive PRGs. The incidence of amphipod toxicity in bioassays using canal\nsediment was also consistently observed in toxicity tests conducted by National Grid\n(GEI, 2011; GEI, 2012a and GEI 2012b) and NYCDEP (NYCDEP, 2013).\nBoth graphical and statistical approaches were used to derive a PRG for PAHs.\nRegression analysis was attempted, but the confidence intervals around the PRG\nestimates were large, indicating high variability of the dose-response relationships.\nTherefore, the EPA relied on the graphical approach and the regression analysis was\nused only to verify the PRGs that were developed using the graphical approach.\nUsing graphical analysis, two alternative potential PRG calculation approaches for total\nPAHs that represent different levels of protection were determined through graphical\nanalysis of toxicity test results (i.e., examination of plots of total PAH concentration\nversus toxicity for each station tested). The first potential PRG was determined by\ninspecting the graph of the dose-response relationships and identifying the lowest\nobserved adverse effect concentration (LOAEC). The second potential PRG was\n47\ndetermined by selecting the concentration immediately below the LOAEC, which is the\ngreatest no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC). The potential PRGs\nbased on the NOAEC ranged from 39 mg/kg for amphipod survival to 7.8 mg/kg for\namphipod growth and reproduction. Potential PRGs based on the LOAEC for total\nPAHs ranged from 67 mg/kg for amphipod survival to 14 mg/kg for amphipod growth\nand reproduction.\nBecause of the sample size and the variability of the Site-specific dose-response\nrelationships, there is uncertainty in the NOAECs and LOAECs identified above for\neach endpoint. This uncertainty was addressed using the following approach:\n Identify all potential NOAECs and LOAECs from the Site-specific data using\ngraphical analysis.\n Normalize the potential NOAECs and LOAECs for TOC content because organic\ncarbon is a key parameter influencing PAH bioavailability and the TOC content of\nsamples from the key stations varied.\n Calculate the geometric means of the TOC-normalized NOAECs and LOAECs.\n Convert the geometric means of the TOC-normalized NOAECs and LOAECs to a\ndry weight basis using the mean canal-wide surface sediment TOC concentration of\n6 percent.\nThe NOAEC represents the concentration assumed to not cause adverse effects based\non the Site-specific data. The LOAEC represents the lowest concentration associated\nwith measureable effects. The threshold where effects start can be assumed to fall\nbetween those two concentrations. This threshold is commonly calculated at the\ngeometric mean of the NOAEC and LOAEC. Therefore, the PRG for total PAHs was\ncalculated as the geometric mean of the LOAEC and the NOAEC (see Table 15).\nAdditional data and analyses from the RI were considered in evaluating the efficacy of\nthe PRGs. Site-specific bioavailability of PAHs is important in interpreting sediment\ntoxicity test results. The bioavailability and potential toxicity of total PAHs in Gowanus\nCanal sediments were evaluated using the Equilibrium-Partitioning Sediment\nBenchmark Toxic Unit approach (described in EPA, 2003a), which estimates the\nbioavailable and potentially toxic fraction of the total PAHs in the bulk sediment. The\nresults indicate that the PAHs are generally bioavailable and potentially toxic in the\ncanal samples. These results are consistent with recent sediment pore water sampling\nresults presented in Sediment and Surface Water Sampling Winter Report for the\nGowanus Canal Superfund Site (GEI, 2011). Calculated toxic units based on PAHs\nmeasured in sediment porewater samples show that PAHs are bioavailable and\npotentially toxic throughout the canal.\nThe RI also identified metals as contributing to unacceptable ecological risks to benthic\norganisms. Based on measured concentrations in sediment, copper and lead were\n48\nidentified as the metals most likely associated with adverse effects. However,\ngeochemical analyses (i.e., SEM/AVS) indicate that these metals currently are\nminimally bioavailable and should not cause toxicity. However, metals may become\nbioavailable in the future if geochemical conditions in the canal change and do not\nfavor the formation of insoluble sulfides. Therefore, PRGs for copper and lead are\nnecessary in the event that metals become bioavailable and toxic in the future. The\nmaximum Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay concentrations for the reference\nstations that showed no toxicity were selected as the PRGs for copper and lead (see\nTable 15).\nProtection of Herbivorous Birds\nThe BERA found unacceptable risks to herbivorous birds through dietary exposure to\nPAHs. A total PAH PRG for protection of herbivorous birds was derived using the food\nweb model developed for the BERA. The model was used to estimate the total PAH\nconcentration in sediment that would not pose an unacceptable risk to water fowl\neating aquatic plants in the Gowanus Canal.\nPreliminary Remediation Goals for Protection of Ecological Community\nPRGs for the protection of the ecological community for the post-remedy clean surface\nare summarized in Table 15. The PRGs will be used as performance standards for the\npost-remedy “clean” surface.\nThe PAH PRG of 20 mg/kg is specific to this Site; it is based on a Site-specific risk\nanalysis. As a comparison, it is also within the range of published and commonly\naccepted sediment quality values for PAHs (Ingersoll et al., 1996; Long and Morgan,\n1991; MacDonald, 1994 and Swartz, 1999). While not intended for use as PRGs, these\nvalues have been shown to be broadly predictive of sediment toxicity. Refined\ntechniques for directly measuring PAH toxicity and assessment methodology continue\nto develop (e.g., Burgess, 2009). Data recently collected from candidate reference\nareas for the Newtown Creek Superfund site RI indicate that PAH concentrations in\nenclosed and semi-enclosed industrial embayments without CSOs are comparable to\nthe reference area concentrations measured in the Gowanus Canal RI. As was noted\nabove, the EPA evaluated toxicity tests conducted by National Grid in 2011 and 2012\nand by NYCDEP in 2013 and concluded that amphipod toxicity was consistently\nobserved in all of these bioassays using Gowanus Canal sediment.\nThe comparison of PAH concentrations in sediment to the PRGs shows that the entire\nsoft sediment column throughout the project area needs to be addressed. In addition,\nPAH concentrations in the majority of native sediment underlying the soft sediment\nnorth of the Gowanus Expressway also exceed the PRGs. Additionally, NAPL is\npresent in native sediment north of the Gowanus Expressway to at least the maximum\n49\ndepth investigated in the RI (i.e., generally 6 feet below the interface between soft and\nnative sediments). NAPL saturation was not observed in the native sediment south of\nthe Gowanus Expressway.\nThe EPA has adopted the PRGs identified above as the final Remediation Goals (RGs)\nfor the Site.\nSUMMARY OF REMEDIAL ALTERNATIVES\nCERCLA Section 121(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. Section 9621(b)(1), mandates that remedial\nactions be protective of human health and the environment, cost-effective, comply with\nARARs and utilize permanent solutions, alternative treatment technologies and\nresource recovery alternatives to the maximum extent practicable. Section 121(b)(1)\nalso establishes a preference for remedial actions which employ, as a principal\nelement, treatment to reduce the volume, toxicity or mobility of the hazardous\nsubstances, pollutants and contaminants at a site permanently and significantly.\nCERCLA Section 121(d), 42 U.S.C. Section 9621(d), further specifies that a remedial\naction must attain a level or standard of control of the hazardous substances, pollutants\nand contaminants, which at least attains ARARs under federal and state laws, unless a\nwaiver can be justified pursuant to CERCLA Section 121(d)(4), 42 U.S.C. Section\n9621(d)(4). Remedial alternatives are described below for the sediment and source\ncontrol.\nSediment Alternatives\nDetailed descriptions of the remedial alternatives for addressing the contaminated\nsediments can be found in the FS report. Seven dredging and capping remedial\nalternatives were considered in the FS report:\n Alternative 1: no action.\n Alternative 2: partially dredge soft sediment and cap with isolation layer and armor\nlayer.\n Alternative 3: partially dredge soft sediment and cap with treatment layer, isolation\nlayer and armor layer.\n Alternative 4: dredge entire soft sediment column and cap with isolation layer and\narmor layer.\n Alternative 5: dredge entire soft sediment column and cap with treatment layer,\nisolation layer and armor layer.\n Alternative 6: dredge entire soft sediment column, stabilize top 3–5 feet of native\nsediment in targeted areas and cap with isolation layer and armor layer.\n Alternative 7: dredge entire soft sediment column, stabilize top 3–5 feet of native\nsediment in targeted areas and cap with treatment layer, isolation layer and armor\nlayer.\n50\nAlternatives 1, 5 and 7 were retained for further development and detailed evaluation;\nAlternatives 2, 3, 4 and 6 were screened out for the following reasons: Alternatives 2\nand 3 include only partial removal of the soft sediment column. Although it may be\npossible to cap soft sediments which are stable in their composition and aquatic\nenvironment, the soft sediment column within the canal does not exhibit these\ncharacteristics. The column is subject to decomposition due to its organic nature,\nwhich is highly influenced by contaminated CSO solids, and subject to disturbance from\nvessels, tidal and weather conditions, and flushing tunnel operation. Capping\nextremely soft, fine-grained sediments with high water content poses technical\nchallenges due to the sediments’ low bearing capacity (USACE, 2000). Evaluation of\ngeotechnical data submitted by National Grid in 2013 showed that capping on top of\nnative sediment would be much more reliable than capping on soft sediment due to\nsettlement. Contaminant levels deeper within the soft sediment column are generally\ngreater due to older historic discharges and the influence of NAPL infiltration. Partial\nremoval would therefore leave a large volume of impacted sediments with a broad\nrange and high levels of residual contamination. Ebullition potential from partially\nleaving the high organic content soft sediments would still exist, increasing the risks of\ncap failure. Partial removal would also result in shallower cap depth, increasing cap\ndamage potential from navigation. Complete soft sediment removal will eliminate\nmobility of those hazardous substances. Following removal, the soft sediment can be\ntreated. This is consistent with CERCLA’s statutory preference for actions in which\ntreatment permanently and significantly reduces the volume, toxicity or mobility of the\nhazardous substances.32 Given these risk management considerations, all of the soft\nsediment would need to be removed in order to ensure that the remedy will be\nprotective of human health and the environment.\nAlternatives 2, 4 and 6 include installation of a two-layer cap, with isolation and armor\nlayers. These alternatives were not retained because an armored sand cap is not\nsufficient to control the long-term flux of NAPL and dissolved-phase contaminants.\nWhile the temporary draining of all or portions of the canal to facilitate implementation\nof the remedy was considered, it was ruled out for the entire canal for several reasons:\nremoval of canal water could induce canal wall and bottom instabilities due to\nincreased exerted pressures; draining of the canal for remedy implementation would\nlimit remedial and commercial barge access and conflict with the current configuration\nfor CSO and stormwater discharges; and odor control for such a large area of\ndewatered sediments would be difficult.\nFactors which determine the necessary depth of dredging include the extent of\n32 “Remedial actions in which treatment which permanently and significantly reduces the\nvolume, toxicity or mobility of the hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants is a\nprincipal element, are to be preferred over remedial actions not involving such treatment.”\nSee CERCLA Section 121(b)(1).\n51\nsediment chemical contamination and the presence of NAPL, navigational needs and\nremedy implementation needs, as described below. RTA 1 is no longer used for\ncommercial navigation. However, this reach of the canal must have sufficient depth to\noperate the flushing tunnel and vessels will need to navigate this reach of the canal to\nperform cap monitoring and maintenance, as well as sewer system and flushing tunnel\nmaintenance and bridge and bulkhead repairs. The final dredge depth would need to\nensure that the final sediment surface remains submerged throughout the tidal cycle\nand minimize remedy implementation challenges (e.g., allow sufficient water depth for\nconstruction work throughout the tidal cycle). In RTA 2, a navigation depth of -16 feet\nNAVD88 was used based on a 2009 dredging alternative analysis performed by the\nUSACE which selected that depth for maintaining commercial navigation. The dredging\ndepth in RTA 3 is in accordance with the federally-authorized navigation depth south of\nHamilton Avenue--Hamilton to Sigourney Street, the authorized channel is 18 feet deep\nrelative to MLLW; between Sigourney and Percival Street, the authorized depth\nincreases to 30 feet deep relative to MLLW. These depths are equivalent to\napproximately -21 and -33 feet NAVD88, respectively.\nCapping is a component of all alternatives, except the No- Action alternative, because\nNAPL-contaminated sediments are present to depths that exceed the practicable depth\nof removal. A capping-only alternative was not included since a cap in RTA 1 would\nfurther restrict the water depth in the canal and result in a relatively large area of\nexposed sediment at low tide, a cap in RTA 2 would compress soft sediments and\nmobilize the NAPL within them and a capping-only remedy would be incompatible with\nthe continued use of the canal for commercial navigation.\nThe sediments dredged under any of the alternatives can be treated and/or disposed of\nusing a variety of methods. The following treatment and disposal options for dredged\nsediments were identified and retained for further development and detailed evaluation:\n Option A: Off-Site thermal desorption and beneficial use.\n Option B: Off-Site disposal (landfill).\n Option C: Off-Site cogeneration and beneficial use.\n Option D: Off-Site stabilization and off-Site beneficial use.\n Option E: On-Site stabilization and on-Site beneficial use.\n Option F: Off-Site stabilization and placement in on-Site constructed CDF.\n Option G: On-Site stabilization and placement in on-Site constructed CDF.\nSource Control Remedial Components and Costs\nThere are multiple sources of contamination causing on-going releases into the canal\nwhich must be controlled in order for the sediment remedy selected herein to be\nprotective of human health and the environment and to be effective and sustainable.\nTherefore, implementation of control measures to address all other contaminant\n52\nsources, either through state cleanup authorities or direct selection as part of this\nremedy, are common and integral to ensuring the effectiveness of both of the sediment\naction alternatives.\nThe primary on-going sources are the three former MGP facilities and the CSOs in the\nupper part of the canal (outfalls RH-034 and OH-007). Unlike more typical upland\nsources to sediment sites, the setting, volume and discharge pathways of these\nsources make addressing them fully integral to the selected remedy.\nThe three former MGP facilities are being addressed by National Grid pursuant to\nadministrative orders with NYSDEC. The remedy selection for the three former MGP\nfacilities is not within the scope of this decision document. However, significant\nportions of the remedial work for the three former MGP facilities are expected to occur\nin the canal, requiring coordination with the sediment remedy. As a result of the\nconcentrated levels and widespread prevalence of MGP-related NAPL, the degree of\nMGP source control may also affect cap design for the sediment remedy. Finally, the\ncost of the MGP-related remedies is anticipated to be in a similar range as the selected\nsediment remedy. As a result, detailed information is provided below regarding the\ndynamic relationship between the selected sediment remedy and the remediation of\nthe former MGP facilities to establish that appropriate consideration has been given to\nthis integral, major source.\nWith regard to control of the CSOs, the other major, integral on-going contamination\nsource to canal sediments, the selected remedy requires implementation of specific\nmeasures to significantly reduce contaminated CSO solids discharges to the upper\ncanal. Although not considered for CERCLA remedy selection purposes, the remedy\nwill also help address the presence of pathogens introduced into the canal by the\nongoing CSO discharges.\nFormer Manufactured Gas Plant Source Control Measures and Costs –\nConcurrent Work under Separate State Authority\nNYSDEC has not yet completed the remedy selection process for the former Fulton\nand Metropolitan MGP facilities. However, NYSDEC has selected a remedy for the\nPublic Place former MGP facility. All of the major reports for the three former MGP\nfacilities, including the screening of remedial alternatives for Public Place, have been\nreviewed by the EPA and are included in the EPA’s Administrative Record. New York\nState guidance governing the State Superfund program requires source removal or\ncontrol for all remedies. This will ensure that the remedies for the two other former\nMGP facilities will adequately address the sources. The costs for addressing the Public\nPlace former MGP facility are estimated by National Grid at $175-200 million, based on\nNYSDEC’s selected remedy and National Grid’s remedial design work performed to\ndate. It is assumed that the costs for the two other sites will each be in the same range\n53\nor less.\nCSO Solids Control Measures and Costs\nTo address the discharge of hazardous substances, such as PAHs associated with\ntypical urban drainage, the following CSO control measures were screened based on\neffectiveness, implementability and cost (see the FS report addendum): no action;\noptimization of existing trap chamber in CSO OH-007; CSO sediment trap at CSO RH-\n034; silt curtains and/or netting facilities, maintenance dredging; sewer cleaning and\nCSO storage. The permanent installation of silt curtains was screened out based on\nthe fact that they would not provide sufficient solids control and they would deteriorate\nand require extensive maintenance over the long term in large part due to the surface\nwater velocities in the canal once the flushing tunnel is put back into operation. The\ntemporary use of silt curtains during dredging operations will be evaluated as part of\nthe remedial design, but silt curtains are not practicable as a permanent source control\noption.\nAs is noted above, to ensure continued protection of the canal remedy, future\npermanent CSO sediment controls are required. The only practicable, cost-effective\nmeasure for control of this volume of contaminated CSO solids is the use of retention\ntanks. Scientific literature suggests that it can be assumed that the “first flush”\ncomprises approximately 20% of the total discharge volume and contains between\n30% and 60% of the total PAH load of the discharge (Stein, 2006). The first flush\nphenomenon under urban settings with regard to the discharge of contaminants such\nas PAHs and metals has been studied in various geographic regions in the U.S. that\nexperience different hydrologic patterns and various levels of urbanization. For\nexample, studies have been performed in an ultra-urban area in Maryland and the\nDistrict of Columbia (Flint and Davis, 2007), California (Lau et al,. 2009; Stenstrom and\nKayhanian, 2005; Li et. al., 2008), Ohio (Sansalone and Buchberger, 1997), Florida\n(Mitsova et al., 2011); and across other countries/continents (Bertrand-Krajewski, 1998;\nDeletic, 1998; Larsen et al., 1998; Lee et Al,. 2002; Nazahiyah, 2007 and Zhang et. al.,\n2009). These studies demonstrate that first flush phenomenon is observed for various\nprecipitation patterns and different chemical compositions, including those for metals\nand PAHs. In summary, the findings of these studies across the country are consistent\nwith Stein et al. (2006), which states that “within individual storms, PAHs exhibited a\nmoderate first flush with between 30% and 60% of the total PAH load being discharged\nin the first 20% of the storm volume.” Therefore, the first flush concept and taking\nadvantage of it for controlling CSO discharges are directly applicable to the CSO\ncontrols developed for the Gowanus Canal.\nA CSO solids reduction of 58 to 74 percent was preliminarily estimated to be needed at\noutfall RH-034 to meet the RGs of four contaminants (total PAH, copper, lead and total\nPCBs) including a 51 to 71 percent reduction needed for total PAHs. (see the FS report\naddendum). Similar reductions will be needed for outfall OH-007. That level of\n54\nreduction would require capturing more than 20 percent of the initial CSO discharge\nvolume when factoring in the first flush capture effect.\nIt is anticipated that capturing approximately twice the amount of the first flush of the\ndesign storm event from CSO outfalls RH-034 and OH-007 (WB/WS Plan)33 can\nprovide an initial estimate of the degree of control needed so that the protectiveness of\nthe remedy is maintained. In order to achieve this minimum level of contaminated CSO\nsolids control, based on the preliminary screening, in-line sewage retention tanks34\nwould be constructed near outfalls RH-034 and OH-007 unless other technically viable\nalternatives are identified. Tank volumes of 6- to 8-million gallons and 3- to 4-million\ngallons were preliminarily selected for outfalls RH-034 and OH-007, respectively, on\nthe basis of their capacity to reduce CSO volume and solids in an amount that will\nprevent recontamination of the canal after the implementation of the sediment cleanup\ncomponents of the remedy.\nFor costing purposes, an 8-million-gallon in-line retention tank (estimated by the EPA to\ncost $46,429,000 to construct) would be installed for outfall RH-034 and a 4-million-\ngallon in-line retention tank (estimated by the EPA to cost $31,272,000) would be\ninstalled for outfall OH-007.35 For the purpose of developing construction costs\nassociated with CSO control, it was assumed that these tanks could be located on\navailable NYC-owned land in the vicinity of the outfalls. The final selection of CSO\ncontrol retention tank locations, as well as any further evaluations of measures to\nprevent recontamination of canal sediments, will be completed during the remedial\ndesign and in coordination with the contemporaneous LTCP development process.\nNYCDEP’s has stated that it costs $1 million per year to operate its Alley Creek CSO\nstorage tank and $2 million per year to remove grit alone at its Flushing CSO storage\n33 The EPA recognizes that, in the future, there may be more frequent large rainfall events due\nto climate change.\n34 As was noted above, combined sewers receive both sewage and stormwater flows, and\ndischarge to the canal when the sewer system’s capacity is exceeded. Rather than\ndischarging the sewage and stormwater to the surface water when the system’s capacity is\nexceeded, the excess flow would be diverted to tanks, which would store it until the wet\nweather subsides, when it would be pumped to the WWTP.\n36 The cost includes $172,000,000 to address the contaminated sediments (this cost does not\ninclude treatment and disposal of dredged sediment which are dependent upon the disposal\nand treatment option selected), $77,701,000 to install in-line storage tanks for outfalls RH-\n034 and OH-007 (8 million gallons and 4 million gallons, respectively) and $20,000,000 for\nthe excavation and restoration of the portion of the filled-in former 1st Street turning basin,\nthe excavation and restoration of the portion of the 4th Street turning basin underneath the\n3rd Avenue bridge and the installation of a barrier or interception system on the 5th Street\nturning basin side of the bridge. The cost does not include remedial measures, such as the\ninstallation of cut-off walls, source removal or groundwater/NAPL collection systems at the\nthree former MGPs, which will be implemented under State authorities.\n55\ntank. Based on the sizes of those facilities alone (and not taking into account the\nfrequency of use and actual volumes of CSO stored among other differentiating\nfactors), the O&M cost is $0.20/million gallons per year (MG/yr) including\n$0.05/MG/year for grit removal. With that cost basis, the combined costs of operating\ntwo tanks at Gowanus Canal may be on the order of $2,400,000 per year ($1,600,000\nfor RH-034, $800,000 for OH-007).\nNYC is under order with New York State to achieve the water quality goals of the CWA\nand must ultimately meet the “highest attainable use” per the EPA’s LTCP guidance.\nThe LTCP, which is due to the State in June 2015, is expected to address, at a\nminimum, the EPA’s remedial performance goals as noted above, for further\ncontaminated CSO solids control in the upper reach of the canal. The EPA and\nNYSDEC are committed to work together throughout the development of the remedial\ndesign and the contemporaneous LTCP development process to ensure that both the\nSuperfund and CWA goals are met in a timely, cost-effective manner. The EPA seeks\nto coordinate the CERCLA and CWA processes to the extent practicable, to ensure\nthat the selected CERCLA remedy is implemented in an effective and timely manner.\nSince the EPA is incorporating contaminated CSO solids control in the remedy\nselection, siting, remedial design and remedial action pursuant to the authority of\nCERCLA, certain CERCLA statutory authorities, including, but not limited to, permit\nexemption and environmental impact statement functional equivalency apply.\nSince the design and construction of permanent long-term CSO controls for the\nSuperfund remedy might not take place by the time remedial dredging is carried out,\ninterim contaminated CSO solids control measures would need to be developed during\nthe remedial design to control the discharges until the permanent measures are\nimplemented.\nCurrent and future high density residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal\nand within the sewershed would need to adhere to NYC rules for sewer connections\n(Chapter 31 of Title 15 of the Rules of the City of New York) and be consistent with\nrecently adopted NYC criteria for on-Site stormwater control and green infrastructure\n(NYCDEP, 2012) so as to ensure that hazardous substances and solids from additional\nsewage loads do not compromise the effectiveness of the permanent CSO control\nmeasures by exceeding their design capacity. In addition, separated stormwater\noutfalls may also require source controls pursuant to applicable SPDES permits and\nbest management practices. In particular, such separated stormwater outfalls would\nneed to utilize appropriate engineering controls to minimize the discharges of\nhazardous substances and solids.\nAdditional Source Control Measures and Costs\nThe costs to address the other (non-MGP) upland sources will vary from parcel to\n56\nparcel and will depend on source control options that may include excavation, cutoff\nwalls and other measures. The EPA did not estimate the costs of remediating these\nadditional parcels as part of the FS and, thus, those costs are not directly included in\nthe overall remedy costs. However, the EPA believes that, in comparison to the\noverall anticipated canal remedy cost, the cost of addressing each of these parcels\nwould be small. The EPA anticipates that separate cleanup determinations will be\nmade for such parcels under the appropriate cleanup program. The appropriate\nremedial measures and costs of these non-MGP upland sources will be addressed in\nthose separate cleanup determinations. Based upon discussions with property owners\nwilling to implement such measures for redevelopment purposes voluntarily, such\nmeasures are likely to cost several million dollars or less per property. In the unlikely\nevent that a timely and effective state-selected remedy is not implemented at a given\nnon-MGP facility, the EPA may implement actions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure the\nprotectiveness of the selected remedy.\nThe costs to address the non-CSO open pipes along the canal are expected to be\nminimal in comparison to the overall Site remedy costs and would involve either sealing\nthe pipes or requiring the property owner to obtain the necessary permit to continue the\ndischarge. To reduce sewer, stormwater and runoff contaminant inputs, the EPA and\nNYCDEP have also discussed the use of “Best Management Practices” by various\nbusiness sectors (e.g., auto repair, vehicle storage) near the canal. The EPA\nanticipates that these measures will be implemented in a phased manner over the\ncourse of the remedial action through compliance assistance efforts and, as\nappropriate, enforcement actions.\nSediment Dredging, Capping and Disposal Alternatives\nThe sediment dredging, capping and disposal alternatives described below also\ninclude the excavation and restoration of approximately 475 feet of the filled-in former\n1st Street turning basin and the excavation and restoration of a portion of the 5th Street\nturning basin beginning underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and extending the\nexcavation approximately 25 feet to the east, and the installation of a barrier or\ninterception system at the eastern boundary of the excavation.\nThe construction time of approximately six years for each alternative reflects only the\ntime required to construct or implement the remedy and achieve the RAOs. This\nperiod does not include the time required to discuss the design and implementation of\nthe remedy with PRPs and to prepare the enforcement agreement that will govern this\nwork, the time required for the design of the remedy, including the procurement of\ncontracts, and the time for the procurement of contracts for the implementation of the\nremedy. This period also does not include time needed for enforcement-related\nactivities, including time to discuss and come to an enforcement agreement with PRPs\nfor the operational details for the performance of the work.\nThe sediment dredging, capping and disposal remedial alternatives are:\n57\nAlternative 1: No Action\nCapital Cost: $0\nAnnual Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Cost: $0\nPresent-Worth Cost: $0\nConstruction Time: 0 months\nThe Superfund program requires that the \"no-action\" alternative be considered as a\nbaseline for comparison with the other alternatives. The no-action remedial alternative\ndoes not include any physical remedial measures that address the contamination at the\nSite.\nBecause this alternative would result in contaminants remaining above levels that allow\nfor unrestricted use and unlimited exposure, CERCLA requires that the Site be\nreviewed at least once every five years. If justified by the review, remedial actions may\nneed to be implemented to remove, treat or contain the contaminated soils and\nsediments.\nAlternative 5: Dredge Entire Soft Sediment Column; Cap with Treatment,\nIsolation and Armor Layers\nVolume of Sediment Removed: 588,000 cubic yards (CY)\nCapital Cost: $270,000,00036\nAnnual O&M Costs: $4,400,00037\nPresent-Worth Cost: $272,000,000\nConstruction Time: 6 years\nUnder this alternative, all of the soft sediment within the canal would be removed and a\ncap would be placed on top of the native sediment surface.\n36 The cost includes $172,000,000 to address the contaminated sediments (this cost does not\ninclude treatment and disposal of dredged sediment which are dependent upon the disposal\nand treatment option selected), $77,701,000 to install in-line storage tanks for outfalls RH-\n034 and OH-007 (8 million gallons and 4 million gallons, respectively) and $20,000,000 for\nthe excavation and restoration of the portion of the filled-in former 1st Street turning basin,\nthe excavation and restoration of the portion of the 4th Street turning basin underneath the\n3rd Avenue bridge and the installation of a barrier or interception system on the 5th Street\nturning basin side of the bridge. The cost does not include remedial measures, such as the\ninstallation of cut-off walls, source removal or groundwater/NAPL collection systems at the\nthree former MGPs, which will be implemented under State authorities.\n37 This cost includes O&M related to the contaminated sediments and contaminated CSO\nsolids controls (such as in-line storage tanks). It does not include O&M costs related to the\nthree former MGPs.\n58\nThe native sediment surface elevation is variable within the canal; therefore, there is\nnot a single specific removal depth in RTAs 1 or 3 under this alternative. In RTA 1, the\nnative surface elevation ranges from -11.8 to -25.6 feet NAVD88. In RTA 3, the native\nsurface elevation—and therefore the target dredge elevation—ranges from -18.9 to -\n44.2 feet NAVD88. The removal of all the soft sediment would allow for the placement\nof the cap and, at the same time, meet maintenance considerations in RTA 1 and\nnavigational needs in RTAs 2 and 3.\nIn RTA 2, a navigation depth of -16 feet NAVD88 was assumed based on present\ncommercial navigational needs. Therefore, all of the soft sediment and some native\nsediment would be removed to accommodate the cap thickness and allow for\ncontinued commercial vessel use in this reach.\nThe cap for this alternative would consist of an armor layer, an isolation layer and an\nactive treatment layer as follows from top to bottom:\n Armor layer: Stone sized to meet the erosion forces of the flushing tunnel and\nnavigation impacts. Sufficient sand would be placed on top of the armor layer to fill\nin the voids between the stones and to establish sufficient depth of soft sediment in\norder to facilitate benthic recolonization.\n Isolation layer: Approximately 1 foot thick consisting of 0.5 feet of gravel and 0.5\nfeet of sand to provide transition and erosion protection of the treatment layer\nmaterial from the overlying heavier armor layer.\n Treatment layer (represented in the FS by oleophilic clay): Conceptually consisting\nof 1 foot in RTA 1 and RTA 2 and 0.5 feet in RTA 3 of an oleophilic clay-sand\nmixture, with the exact configuration to be determined during the remedial design.\nThe cap would need to be designed to tolerate future maintenance dredging operations\nin the canal for the removal of contaminated solids that might settle on top of it. If\npossible, the treatment layer component of the cap would be designed to have an\nadequate life expectancy for absorbing NAPL without replacement. For areas with high\nNAPL or impacted groundwater discharge, treatment gates (i.e., NAPL sump) will likely\nbe needed where the treatment media can be removed without disturbing the cap\noutside these areas.\nThis alternative would include periodic maintenance of the cap and long-term\nmonitoring to insure that the remedy continues to function effectively.\nThis alternative would also include institutional controls incorporating the existing fish\nconsumption advisories (modified, as needed), as well as other controls to protect the\nintegrity of the cap and limit construction within the canal, including bulkhead\nmaintenance and navigation dredging within the canal.\n59\nBecause this alternative would result in contaminants remaining on-Site above levels\nthat allow for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure, CERCLA requires that the Site\nbe reviewed at least once every five years.\nAlternative 7: Dredge Entire Soft Sediment Column; Perform In-Situ Sediment\nStabilization; Cap with Treatment, Isolation and Armor Layers\nVolume Sediment Removed: 588,000 CY\nCapital Cost: $286,000,00038\nAnnual O&M Costs: $4,400,00039\nPresent-Worth Cost: $288,000,000\nConstruction Time: 6 years\nUnder this alternative, all of the soft sediment within the canal would be removed and\nISS would be applied to targeted areas of native sediment to immobilize NAPL with\nupward migration potential. ISS would be performed to a depth of 3 to 5 feet and would\nconsist of incorporating pozzolanic and/or adsorptive additives into the native sediment\nto stabilize the material. ISS would be applied to areas where data indicate the\npotential for active upward NAPL migration from the native sediment. The stabilization\nmaterial would be delivered to the sediment in-situ from a barge using large augers\nwithout dewatering the canal. The area being stabilized would be surrounded by\ntemporary sheet-piling to contain the contaminants that would be released when the\naugers are in use. Any impacted water would be treated as necessary.\nThe depth of removal for RTAs 1, 2 and 3 would be the same as Alternative 5.\nThe conceptual cap for this alternative would be the same as the cap described for\nAlternative 5, an armor layer, an isolation layer and a treatment layer (represented by\noleophilic clay). In addition, treatment layer design will need to be incorporated into the\n38 The cost includes $188,000,000 to address the contaminated sediments (this cost does not\ninclude treatment and disposal of dredged sediment which are dependent upon the disposal\nand treatment option selected) and $77,701,000 to install in-line storage tanks for outfalls\nRH-034 and OH-007 (8 million gallons and 4 million gallons, respectively) and $20,000,000\nfor the excavation and restoration of the portion of the filled-in former 1st Street turning basin,\nthe excavation and restoration of the portion of the 4th Street turning basin underneath the\n3rd Avenue bridge and the installation of a barrier or interception system on the 5th Street\nturning basin side of the bridge. The cost does not include remedial measures, such as the\ninstallation of cut-off walls, source removal or groundwater/NAPL collection systems at the\nthree former MGPs, which will be implemented under State authorities.\n39 This cost includes only O&M related to the contaminated sediments and contaminated CSO\nsolids controls (such as in-line storage tanks). It does not include O&M costs related to the\nthree former MGPs.\n60\nstabilized native sediment layer where stabilization is implemented. ISS will inhibit\ngroundwater discharge in the treated areas and treatment gates will likely be needed\nwhere the treatment media can be removed without disturbing the cap outside these\nareas.\nThe cap would need to be designed to tolerate future maintenance dredging operations\nin the canal for the removal of contaminated solids that might settle on top of it. If\npossible, the treatment layer component of the cap would be designed to have an\nadequate life expectancy for absorbing NAPL without replacement. If this is not\nfeasible, the alternative may include the replacement of portions of the treatment layer\n(replacing the treatment layer would also necessitate the removal and replacement of\nthe overlying sand and armor layers).\nThis alternative would include periodic maintenance of the cap and long-term\nmonitoring to insure that the remedy continues to function effectively.\nThis alternative would also include institutional controls incorporating the existing fish\nconsumption advisories (modified, as needed), as well as other controls to protect the\nintegrity of the cap and in-situ stabilized material and limit construction within the\ncanal, including bulkhead maintenance and navigation dredging within the canal.\nBecause this alternative would result in contaminants remaining on-Site above levels\nthat allow for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure, CERCLA requires that the Site\nbe reviewed at least once every five years.\nTreatment and Disposal Options\nThis section describes the treatment and disposal or beneficial-use options that may\nbe utilized to address sediments removed through the above-noted dredging and\ncapping alternatives. All treatment and disposal facility selection and beneficial use\ndeterminations would be subject to the EPA oversight and approval. Due to the\ndifferences in the extent of NAPL contamination in different areas of the canal, some\nof the treatment and disposal options are not applicable to all RTAs. The seven\ntreatment and disposal options with the RTAs to which they apply (noted in\nparenthesis) are:\n Option A: Off-Site thermal desorption and beneficial use (RTAs 1, 2 and 3).\n Option B: Off-Site disposal (landfill; RTAs 1, 2 and 3).\n Option C: Off-Site cogeneration and beneficial use (RTAs 1, 2 and 3).\n Option D: Off-Site stabilization and off-Site beneficial use (RTAs 1 and 3).\n Option E: On-Site stabilization and on-Site beneficial use (RTAs 1 and 3).\n Option F: Off-Site stabilization and placement in on-Site constructed CDF (RTA 3).\n Option G: On-Site stabilization and placement in on-Site constructed CDF (RTA 3).\n61\nThe relative cost rankings for these disposal and treatment options are influenced by\ntipping fees, specific treatment technology and transport distance required. The\napproximate costs for the treatment and disposal options range from approximately\n$170 to $320 per ton.\nAll of the treatment/disposal options include barging of the dredged sediment to a\nlocal, on-Site dewatering and transfer facility.\nAdditional treatability testing and sampling would be needed for all of the options.\nFurther testing of stabilized sediment would be required to confirm that dredged\nsediment can be accepted by thermal desorption (Option A) and cogeneration (Option\nC) facilities. Utilization of Option B (off-Site landfill) would require testing of the\nstabilized dredged sediment to confirm that it would meet acceptance criteria. Options\nD, E, F and G would require further evaluations to determine the appropriate reagents\nand dosing required for stabilization and to assess the leachability of the stabilized\nmaterial. Options D and E would further require a beneficial use to be identified and a\ndetermination as to whether the stabilized sediment would meet the associated\nbeneficial-use requirements. A CDF would be constructed under Options F and G, if\nselected based upon community acceptance and approval by NYSDEC and other\nappropriate governmental regulatory authorities.\nOption A: Off-Site Thermal Desorption and Beneficial Use\nOption A consists of transporting dredged and dewatered sediments by barge to an\noff-Site commercial facility for stabilization, followed by transport of the stabilized\nsediment to another off-Site facility for treatment by thermal desorption. The treatment\nresiduals would be destroyed in an afterburner and the treated sediment would be\ntransported for beneficial use, such as daily cover at a landfill, or for another beneficial\nuse at an off-Site location. To develop the estimated costs, the FS assumed that\ntransport following stabilization would occur by truck. The total PCB and lead\nconcentrations present in the sediment may preclude this treatment option for some\nareas of the canal.\nOption B: Off-Site Disposal (Landfill)\nOption B consists of transporting the stabilized sediment from the off-Site dredge\nmaterial processing facility to an appropriate landfill. It is assumed that transport from\nthe dredge-material-processing facility to the disposal facility would occur by truck.\nDisposal at a RCRA Subtitle D landfill is assumed for the stabilized sediment.\nStabilization would be performed to the degree needed for the dredged sediment to\npass the paint filter test.40\n40 This test method is used to determine the presence of free liquids in a representative sample\nof waste. A predetermined amount of material is placed in a paint filter. If any portion of the\n62\nOption C: Off-Site Cogeneration and Beneficial Use\nOption C consists of transporting dredged, dewatered sediments that have been\nstabilized, as necessary, at the off-Site dredge-material-processing facility to an off-\nSite cogeneration electrical plant. The stabilized sediment would be mixed with coal\nand then burned to generate electricity, which would then be distributed to the\nreceiving electrical grid. The organic contaminants in the sediment would be\ndestroyed through burning of the sediments at high temperatures (greater than\n1,400°C) during the co-generation process. The treated sediment would then be\ntransported for use as daily cover at a landfill or other beneficial use. It is assumed\nthat transport from the off-Site dredge-material-processing facility to the cogeneration\nplant and from the cogeneration plant to the location where the treated sediment\nwould be beneficially used would occur by truck.\nAdditional bench-scale testing would be required to determine whether the sediment in\nall areas of the canal would provide sufficient energy value (in British Thermal Units, or\nBTUs) to make cogeneration a feasible treatment/disposal option for all of the dredge\nsediments and to determine which areas of the canal contain sediment with the\nappropriate BTU value. Bench testing would also be required to determine the amount\nof stabilization materials needed to reduce the moisture content of the material to\napproximately 20 percent (the desired limit for the receiving facilities).\nOption D: Off-Site Stabilization and Beneficial Use\nOption D consists of transporting dewatered sediments to an off-Site dredge material\nprocessing facility via barge, where the sediment would be stabilized to a greater\ndegree than for mere disposal. The treated material would then be transported via truck\nor rail (assumed to be by truck) to the off-Site beneficial use location. Potential\nbeneficial use options include the stabilized sediment’s use as fill or landfill daily cover\nor incorporation into construction materials, such as concrete. A specific beneficial use\napplicant would need to be identified and further evaluations would be required to\nconfirm the amounts and types of stabilizing agents that should be added to the\nsediment to result in the desired physical and chemical properties. Tests to assess the\nleachability of NAPL and other contaminants, as well as the material strength, would\nneed to be performed on the stabilized material in order to determine whether it would\nmeet the beneficial use requirements.\nOption E: On-Site Stabilization and Beneficial Use\nOption E includes stabilizing dredged sediment on-Site and beneficially using the\nmaterial passes through and drops from the filter within the 5-minute test period, the material\nis deemed to contain free liquids.\n63\ntreated sediment in areas adjacent to the canal. As with Option D, the degree of\nstabilization necessary for direct on-Site beneficial use without further treatment would\nneed to be more substantial than the stabilization under Options A through C, where\nthe stabilization process would be utilized to prepare sediments for off-Site transport by\ntruck to be followed by treatment before final disposition. A specific beneficial use has\nnot been determined, but potential uses include fill or creation of concrete blocks.\nAdditional physical and chemical testing and cost analyses would be required to\nevaluate potential beneficial uses. Sediments would need to be stabilized to a degree\nconsistent with their beneficial use including considerations on the leachability of\ncontaminants.\nA beneficial use for this material would need to be identified; the limitations, additional\ndata needs and further evaluations described for Option D also apply to Option E. It is\nassumed that the beneficial use would be in a permanently controlled environment\n(e.g., long-term potential human and ecological direct contact exposures and\ncontaminant release are appropriately limited) and that long-term monitoring would be\nperformed. Permanent institutional controls would be required to ensure the long-term\neffectiveness of this option. A temporary on-Site stabilization facility would need to be\nconstructed and a location for this facility would need to be identified.\nOption F: Off-Site Stabilization and Disposal in On-Site-Constructed CDF\nLesser-contaminated, stabilized sediments could be placed in the CDF41 if approved\nby NYSDEC and other appropriate governmental regulatory authorities,42 which would\nbe filled and covered to match the existing ground surface elevation.\nOption F would apply only to sediments at RTA 3 contaminant levels. RTA 3 sediments\nare less contaminated and with fewer NAPL impacts than the RTA 1 and 2 sediments.\nFor this reason, RTA 3 sediments are more suitable for treatment via stabilization and\nplacement in a CDF. Limiting Option F to RTA 3 sediments (and, space permitting,\nequivalent low level sediments from other areas, especially in RTA 1, that may be\nidentified during design sampling) would also limit the space requirements needed to\nconstruct a CDF. The disposal of the lesser contaminated sediments in a CDF is\nprojected to result in cost savings relative to the off-Site disposal options.\nThis option consists of transporting the stabilized sediment from the off-Site treatment\nfacility back to the Site by barge and then transferring the sediment into an on-Site\nconstructed CDF. The CDF would border water on one side and land on three sides.\nThe layout includes installing a single sheet- pile wall on the sides adjacent to land and\n41 The EPA previously identified a potential CDF location on privately-owned property at the\nGowanus Bay Terminal on Columbia Street in Red Hook.\n42 The EPA will follow OSWER Directive 9355.7-03, Permits and Permit “Equivalency”\nProcesses for CERCLA On-Site Response Actions.\n64\ninstalling a double sheet-pile wall on the side of the CDF adjacent to water. The void in\nthe double sheet-pile wall would be filled with bentonite-augmented soil or a similar\nlow-permeability material. Sufficient stabilization agents (e.g., Portland cement) would\nbe added to the dewatered sediment such that a monolithic mass would result. The\nmaterial would be transferred into the CDF before it was completely hardened and\nwould be placed using standard material-handling equipment. Once the treated\nsediment hardens, leaching is expected to be negligible, so a leachate collection\nsystem would not be necessary. Upon placement of the sediment in the CDF, the CDF\nwould be capped. It is presumed that the top layer of the cap would be asphalt,\nallowing use of the surface. The CDF design would need to ensure long-term\neffectiveness in a coastal marine environment and be approved by NYSDEC and other\nappropriate governmental regulatory authorities. Surveys would be required on a\nregular basis to monitor the long-term integrity of the cap. Cap maintenance would\ninclude placement of additional clean materials/repaving to replace damaged areas of\nthe cap.\nFor cost-estimating purposes, it was assumed that the CDF would accommodate the\nentire volume of sediment removed from RTA 3. The volume of in-situ sediment in RTA\n3 has been estimated at 281,000 CY and an expansion factor of approximately 1.15\nhas been estimated for stabilized material, resulting in a CDF capacity of approximately\n323,000 CY. If the CDF is constructed such that the thickness of stabilized sediment is\n20 feet, the area required for the CDF would be 10 acres.\nBench-scale testing would be needed to determine the amounts of stabilizing agents\nthat should be added to the sediment to result in the desired consistency. Tests to\nassess the leachability of contaminants would also need to be performed on the\nstabilized material in order to refine the CDF design. The design of the CDF would\ndepend on its location and the characteristics of the stabilized sediment. Permanent\ninstitutional controls would be required to protect the long-term integrity of the CDF.\nOption G: On-Site Stabilization and Disposal in On-Site-Constructed CDF\nOption G consists of stabilizing dredged sediment on-Site and then transferring the\nsediment to a constructed on-Site CDF. The CDF would be the same as described in\ndisposal Option F.\nThe disposal under Option G is the same as Option F, with the exception that the\nstabilization would be performed on-Site and transport of sediment to and from an off-\nSite stabilization facility would not be needed. It is assumed that an on-Site temporary\nstabilization facility would be constructed near or adjacent to the CDF location. Three\nconcrete mixing facilities are located on the canal, of which two have expressed\ninterest in providing stabilization services for the project.\n65\nThe costs for the disposal options by RTA are summarized in Table 16.\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES\nDuring the detailed evaluation of remedial alternatives, each alternative is assessed\nagainst nine evaluation criteria, namely, overall protection of human health and the\nenvironment, compliance with ARARs, long-term effectiveness and permanence,\nreduction of toxicity, mobility or volume through treatment, short-term effectiveness,\nimplementability, cost, and state and community acceptance.\nThe evaluation criteria are described below.\n• Overall protection of human health and the environment addresses whether or\nnot a remedy provides adequate protection and describes how risks posed\nthrough each exposure pathway (based on a reasonable maximum exposure\nscenario) are eliminated, reduced or controlled through treatment, engineering\ncontrols or ICs.\n• Compliance with ARARs addresses whether or not a remedy will meet all of the\napplicable or relevant and appropriate requirements of other federal and state\nenvironmental statutes and requirements or provide grounds for invoking a\nwaiver.\n• Long-term effectiveness and permanence refers to the ability of a remedy to\nmaintain reliable protection of human health and the environment over time,\nonce cleanup goals have been met. It also addresses the magnitude and\neffectiveness of the measures that may be required to manage the risk posed by\ntreatment residuals and/or untreated wastes.\n• Reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume through treatment is the anticipated\nperformance of the treatment technologies, with respect to these parameters,\nwhich a remedy may employ.\n• Short-term effectiveness addresses the period of time needed to achieve\nprotection and any adverse impacts on human health and the environment that\nmay be posed during the construction and implementation period until cleanup\ngoals are achieved.\n• Implementability is the technical and administrative feasibility of a remedy,\nincluding the availability of materials and services needed to implement a\nparticular option.\n• Cost includes estimated capital, O&M and present-worth costs.\n66\n• State acceptance indicates whether or not the State concurs with the selected\nremedy.\n• Community acceptance refers to the public's general response to the results of\nRI and the alternatives described in the FS report, FS report addendum and\nProposed Plan.\nA comparative analysis of these alternatives based upon the evaluation criteria noted\nabove follows.\nOverall Protection of Human Health and the Environment\nAlternative 1 would not provide overall protection of human health and the\nenvironment. This alternative would not achieve the RAOs for the canal. Contaminated\nsediments would remain and exposure to these sediments would continue to pose\nhuman health and ecological risks. NAPL migration from the sediment to the surface\nwater would continue and the potential for direct contact with NAPL would remain.\nAlternatives 5 and 7 are expected to be protective of human health and the\nenvironment. These alternatives would meet the RAOs by removing contaminated soft\nsediment and capping with an active treatment layer to reduce and control the long-\nterm risks associated with the native sediment. Placing such an active cap over the\ncontaminated native sediment remaining in the canal would prevent exposure to\nhuman and ecological receptors, thereby reducing and controlling toxicity to benthic\norganisms and eliminating the risks to herbivorous birds. The active cap would also\nprevent direct contact with NAPL and prevent NAPL migration to the surface water of\nthe canal. Bench- scale testing performed by the EPA has demonstrated that ISS can\nsequester NAPL migration in native sediment. Implementation of ISS in targeted areas\nas part of Alternative 7 is expected to provide additional protectiveness against NAPL\nmigration from the native sediment.\nImplementation of Alternatives 5 or 7 would improve the surface water quality of the\nGowanus Canal by controlling and eliminating NAPL migration and preventing contact\nof the surface water with the contaminated sediment.\nImplementation of source controls to address CSO-related releases of hazardous\nsubstances associated with contaminated CSO solids, beyond those currently being\nimplemented by NYCDEP, is necessary to provide overall protection of human health\nand the environment. In particular, such controls are necessary to protect the integrity\nof the canal remedy. By reducing discharges and accumulation of contaminated CSO\nsolids, contaminant concentrations in surface sediments after remedy implementation\nare expected to meet the RGs, which are considered protective of human health and\n67\nthe environment. Absent additional controls, solids contaminated with hazardous\nsubstances will continue to be discharged through the CSOs, and will continue to\nadsorb and concentrate additional releases of hazardous substances, adversely\naffecting the sediments in the canal.\nCompliance with ARARs\nBelow are the principal chemical-specific, action-specific and location-specific ARARs\nfor the Site.\nSince there are currently no federal or state promulgated standards for contaminant\nlevels in sediments in New York, RGs for sediments in the Gowanus Canal were\ndeveloped based on the results of the HHRA and BERA.\nThe EPA and New York State have promulgated surface water standards which are\nenforceable standards for various surface water contaminants. The New York State\nsurface water quality standards are set forth at 6 NYCRR Part 703.\nWhile Alternatives 5 and 7 would be expected to comply with all of the designated\nchemical-specific ARARs, Alternative 1 would not, since there would be no active\nremediation associated with the sediments.\nDuring the implementation of Alternatives 5 and 7, any short-term excursions above\nsurface water ARARs in the canal due to dredging and capping would be expected to\nbe limited to the area in the vicinity of the work zone. Sufficient engineering controls\nwould need to be put in place during dredging and capping to prevent excursions of\nsurface water ARARs outside of the work zone.\nDisposal of solids and liquid collected as part of contaminated CSO solids controls\nwould be implemented in a manner that would achieve chemical-specific ARARs under\nthe CWA. It is anticipated that any sewage stored in retention tanks would be\nprocessed by the existing WWTPs in accordance with each facility’s permits at the\nconclusion of storm events. In the event that solids are generated for disposal at the\ncontaminated CSO solids control (e.g., via maintenance of an in-line CSO retention\nfacility), such disposal would be implemented in a manner which complied with RCRA\nrequirements.\nThe principal action-specific ARARs include CWA Sections 401, 402 and 404; the\nRivers and Harbors Act Section 10; the New York Environmental Conservation Law\n(ECL) Article 15 Water Resources, Article 17 Water Pollution Control and Article 27\nCollection, Treatment and Disposal of Refuse and Other Solid Waste; and associated\nimplementing regulations. Consideration of a CDF would be subject to review by\nNYSDEC and other appropriate governmental regulatory authorities.\n68\nThe CWA Section 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC) is implemented by NYSDEC\nthrough ECL Article 15 and the associated regulations in 6 NYCRR Part 608 Use and\nProtection of Waters. The WQC may establish conditions such as preventive measures\nto minimize re-suspension of sediment and water quality monitoring during dredging,\nso that the remedy would not exceed water quality standards. Placement of fill (such as\na cap or construction of an in-water confined disposal facility) and temporary\ndischarges of decanted waters from dredge barges into waters of the United States\nwould also be addressed through a WQC. The dredging or placement of fill or\nstructures such as bulkheads or in-water confined disposal facilities within navigable\nwaters of the United States and other activities which may adversely affect aquatic\necosystems are regulated by the Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10. Similar activities\nin any waters of the United States are addressed by CWA Section 404 for which the\nUSACE has jurisdiction.\nCWA Section 402 is implemented by NYSDEC through the ECL Article 17 SPDES\nrequirements, which regulate the discharge of pollutants into waters of the state. Pre-\ntreatment or monitoring of decanted water may be imposed and would be applicable to\ndewatering of the sediment at an on-Site noncommercial facility.\nRCRA is the federal law addressing the storage, transportation and disposal of solid\nand hazardous waste. NYSDEC implements RCRA in New York under ECL Article 27.\nThe dredged sediment would be considered solid waste; however, it can be exempted\nfrom being solid waste through the WQC program. If not exempted, RCRA\nrequirements would be applicable.\nIn addition to the ARARs described above, the principal location-specific ARAR is the\nFederal Coastal Zone Management Act administered by the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration, and the associated NYSDEC regulations which apply to\nplacement of bulkhead, sheet-piling within the canal, barge/boat docks, barge\noffloading facilities, boat launches, bridge abutment bulkhead protection, utility\nprotection and dredging. Since both of the action alternatives include dredging and\nactive capping within the canal, the final design of the remedy must meet the\nsubstantive requirements of these regulations. Both action alternatives are expected to\nbe able to comply with all of the designated location-specific and action-specific\nARARs.\nThe CSO outfall source controls would comply with all of the designated chemical-\nspecific, location-specific and action-specific ARARs.\nIf a CDF were to be constructed, the design would need to consider whether the\nsubstantive requirements of the following action-specific ARARs would be triggered\nand indicate how compliance would be achieved:\n69\n Clean Water Act Section 401 certification.\n 6 NYCRR Part 608 Use and Protection of Waters, 6 NYCRR Part 701,\nClassifications-Surface Waters and Groundwaters Clean Water Act Section\n404(b).\n 40 CFR Part 230 Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines for Specification of Disposal Sites\nfor Dredged or Fill Material.\n 40 CFR Part 122 EPA Administered Permit Programs: the National Pollutant\nDischarge Elimination System.\n 40 CFR Part 125 Criteria and Standards for the National Pollutant Discharge\nElimination System.\n Clean Air Act, 40 CFR 50-99.\n New York State ECL Article 1 Title 1.\n New York State ECL Article 3 Title 3.\n New York State ECL Article 15 Title 5.\n New York State ECL Article 11, Title 5.\n New York State ECL Article 17, Title 5.\n New York State ECL Article 19, Title 3.\n 6 NYCRR Parts 200-257–Air Resources.\n NYSDEC - New York Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.\nLong-Term Effectiveness and Permanence\nAlternative 1 would not result in any significant change in risk associated with\ncontaminated sediment or NAPL.\nAlternatives 5 and 7 would result in significant, permanent reduction of the risks\nassociated with contaminated canal sediments and would meet the RAOs. Both\nalternatives would provide long-term protection of human health and the environment.\nThe risks associated with contaminated sediment and NAPL in the canal would be\nreduced over the implementation period of the alternatives as the sediments are\nremoved from the canal. The NAPL-contaminated sediments constitute principal threat\nwaste43 for which removal and treatment is warranted.\nThe active cap would provide long-term control of the risks associated with the native\nsediment in the canal, provided that appropriate long-term cap monitoring and\nmaintenance plans are implemented. Adsorptive caps to control NAPL migration can\nbe designed for a set life expectancy where the NAPL migration rate is known. At the\nMcCormick and Baxter Superfund site in Portland, Oregon, the NAPL discharge rate to\n43 Principal threat wastes are source materials that include or contain hazardous substances\nthat act as a reservoir for the migration of contamination to groundwater, surface water or\nair, or act as a source for direct exposure. These materials are considered to be highly toxic\nor highly mobile and, generally, cannot be reliably contained.\n70\nthe cap was estimated and a design life of more than 100 years established (Blischke\nand Olsta, 2009). NAPL discharge rates at the Gowanus Canal would need to be\ndetermined prior to cap design to establish the appropriate adsorptive cap thickness\nrequirements.\nAlternatives 5 and 7 are considered to have a high degree of effectiveness because all\nthe soft sediment would be removed and the exposure risks associated with the native\nsediment would be controlled by the active cap. The application of ISS to targeted\nareas of native sediment in Alternative 7 would be expected to reduce further the NAPL\nmobility from the native sediment; pilot testing would need to be performed to\ndetermine the most effective, implementable form of ISS within the canal. In the event\nthat ISS is not fully effective, the multilayer cap would provide a redundant level of\nprotectiveness.\nThe seven treatment and disposal options were ranked with respect to long-term\neffectiveness and permanence. Options A, B and C rank high with respect to this\ncriterion because the material would be transferred off-Site and treated or contained in\na managed landfill, alleviating the associated risk. Options D and E (stabilization and\nbeneficial use) are considered to have low to moderate long-term effectiveness. The\neffectiveness would depend on the actual beneficial use. Use as an off-Site landfill\ndaily cover, as is assumed for Option D, would be effective and permanent since the\nmaterial is used in a controlled, monitored environment. Use as on-Site fill or concrete\nblocks could potentially be effective and permanent, but would require testing to ensure\nthat appropriate treatment is applied and would require a suitable, controlled, end-use\nlocation to be identified. Long-term monitoring would also be needed to assure that\nperformance criteria continue to be achieved. Permanent institutional controls would be\nneeded to ensure that long-term potential human direct contact exposures are\nappropriately limited. The institutional controls would need to restrict digging or\nconstruction activities within the fill material and may need to be applied to one or more\nproperties, depending on where the material is used. Depending on the number of\nproperties and where on the properties the fill is placed, more effort and coordination\nmay be needed to ensure successful implementation and enforcement of these\ncontrols. Institutional controls would require sustained application and monitoring to\nassure their success.\nOptions F and G (stabilization and placement into a constructed CDF) are considered\nto have a moderate to high ranking for this criterion because the sediment would\nremain on-Site, but would be contained in an engineered CDF. Under Options F and G,\nthe sediment would be permanently stabilized into a relatively impermeable monolithic\nmass, which is the primary mechanism for reducing or controlling long-term risk. As\npreviously noted, the less-impacted sediments would be placed in the CDF. Long-term\nmonitoring and periodic maintenance would be needed to assure that the CDF\ncontinues to function effectively. Institutional controls, which would be relatively\n71\nstraightforward to implement and maintain, would be required to assure that the CDF\nremains undisturbed.\nThe commingling of solids and associated PAHs and other chemical constituents from\nthe CSO outfalls with sediment and chemical constituents in the canal would potentially\nimpact the integrity and long-term effectiveness of each of the active alternatives.\nContaminated CSO solids control would reduce the mass of solids accumulating in the\ncanal and, thus, reduce the residual risk from contaminants in newly deposited\nsediments after remedy implementation. Treatment of any stored sewage material\nwould occur at the WWTPs in accordance with each facility’s permits at the conclusion\nof storm events. Contaminated CSO solids controls can be designed and implemented\nto provide reliable control of discharges at the selected design criteria, thus, reducing\nthe potential for recontamination and the residual risk after remedy implementation.\nThe reliability of contaminated CSO solids control would require regular inspections\nand maintenance of the controls to ensure that they are operated in accordance with\ndesign criteria. Site management controls relating to future sewer capacity would be\nnecessary to maintain the effectiveness of the CSO measures. Specifically, controls\nwould be utilized to ensure that current and future high density residential\nredevelopment projects along the banks of the canal and within the sewershed would\nbe constructed consistent with current NYC guidelines (NYCDEP, 2012) so as to not\nexceed the designed contaminated CSO solids control capacity, therefore avoiding the\ncontribution of new sewage discharges to the canal that could compromise the remedy.\nSeparated stormwater outfalls may also require discharge treatment controls.\nNYCDEP’s WB/WS Plan, which followed the EPA’s LTCP guidance, was developed\nand approved by the State of New York on July 14, 2009 to achieve planned levels of\nCSO reductions for a typical rainfall year. The control technologies considered by\nNYCDEP for the WB/WS Plan are typical of reliable contaminated CSO solids control\nemployed by NYCDEP and other cities around the world.\nMonitoring of controls in support of the selected remedy can be integrated into\nNYCDEP’s monitoring plans under the WB/WS and LTCP. Specifically, following the\nimplementation of the WB/WS Plan, NYCDEP will perform post-construction monitoring\nto assess the effectiveness of its plan. Monitoring will consist of collecting relevant\nsampling data from the canal, as well as collecting relevant precipitation data and data\ncharacterizing the operation of the sewer system (NYCDEP, 2009). Analyses will be\nperformed to assess compliance with water quality standards as a measure of the\neffectiveness of the WB/WS Plan. Using the collected information, NYCDEP will\nassess whether or not additional CSO controls are needed to achieve compliance with\nthe CWA as part of an Adaptive Management Approach. NYCDEP will then submit in\nJune 2015, an LTCP, which may include additional CSO controls needed for\ncompliance with the CWA and requiring further long-term post-construction monitoring.\n72\nThis monitoring will likely be added to NYCDEP’s SPDES permits and can integrate the\nmonitoring of controls implemented in support of the selected remedy for the canal.\nReduction in Toxicity, Mobility or Volume through Treatment\nAlternative 1 would not result in the reduction in toxicity, mobility or volume of\ncontaminants nor does it include a treatment component.\nThe treatment component included in the Alternatives 5 and 7 cap layout is\nrepresented by a granular oleophilic clay layer. The treatment layer would reduce the\nmobility of NAPL and is considered a treatment technology. The overall reduction of\nNAPL mobility expected to be achieved by the treatment layer is high. Alternative 7 is\nconsidered to have a higher ranking because, while the capping component is the\nsame as that included in Alternative 5, its effectiveness is supplemented by ISS (also a\ntreatment technology). The application of ISS to targeted areas of native sediment in\nAlternative 7 has been shown from bench-scale testing to reduce the NAPL mobility\nfrom the native sediment further; however, pilot testing would need to be performed to\ndetermine the effectiveness and implementability of ISS within the canal.\nThe reduction of toxicity, mobility and volume of the dredged sediment is dependent\nupon the treatment/disposal option selected; therefore, the four treatment/disposal\noptions are evaluated and ranked. Thermal treatment (Option A) and cogeneration\n(Option C) are both ranked high. Both treatment options would significantly reduce or\neliminate the toxicity, mobility and volume associated with the dredged sediment and\nboth options would satisfy the statutory preference for treatment as a principal element\nof the alternative. Disposal Options B (off-Site landfill disposal), D and E (stabilization\nand beneficial use) and F and G (stabilization and placement into a constructed CDF)\nare all ranked as moderate for this criterion. Stabilization of the sediment would reduce\ncontaminant mobility, but toxicity and volume would not be affected. Thermal treatment\n(Option A) and thermal destruction through cogeneration (Option C) are irreversible.\nThe stabilization components of Options F and G are considered irreversible since the\ntreated sediment would be placed in a controlled and monitored disposal facility. The\nirreversibility of stabilization for Options D and E (beneficial use) would be dependent\nupon the conditions where the material is placed and the degree of stabilization\nperformed. Additional testing would be required to determine if an irreversible\nstabilization process can be developed on the basis of beneficial use.\nContaminated CSO solids control would reduce the volume of contaminants and\nadsorbent organic solids discharged to the canal. The controls would permanently\nreduce the mobility of contaminants by capturing and containing solids prior to being\ndischarged to the canal. The captured solids would then undergo appropriate treatment\nand/or disposal, with the specific methods to be determined during the remedial design.\nIt is assumed that stored sewage would be managed at the WWTPs in accordance with\n73\neach facility’s permits at the conclusion of storm events. The capture of the solids\nwould be irreversible, since the solids would be prevented from discharging to the\ncanal. The reduction of toxicity and volume achieved would be designed so that\ncontaminated CSO solids control would result in surface sediment concentrations\nbelow the established RGs. CSO reductions needed to achieve the RGs in surface\nsediments after remedy implementation are estimated to be in the range of 58 to 74\npercent.\nShort-Term Effectiveness\nAlternative 1, No Action, does not include any physical construction measures in any\nareas of contamination and, therefore, would not present any potential adverse impacts\nto on-Site workers or the community as a result of its implementation.\nThe preconstruction Site work, sediment removal and capping components of\nAlternatives 5 and 7 are considered to have moderate short-term effectiveness due to\nthe construction duration and the potential construction-associated risks and short-term\nenvironmental impacts (traffic, odors, noise, etc.). Effective controls can be\nimplemented to address short-term environmental impacts from temporary on-Site\nsediment handling and dewatering. Barges would be used for the transport of dredged\nsediment. Barges would also be used, to the extent possible, to limit traffic impacts\nrelated to the delivery of equipment and supplies and the transport of materials from\nthe work area. Increased barge traffic may, however, result in vehicular traffic impacts\nas a result of more frequent drawbridge openings. Appropriate measures could be\ntaken to limit noise, odors and other impacts associated with dredging and processing\nof the sediments. The short-term effectiveness of the treatment and disposal options is\nevaluated based on the potential short-term impacts to the Site associated with\ntransportation and the transportation distance required. The short-term effectiveness is\nconsidered moderate to high for all of the treatment and disposal options that were\nevaluated.\nThe transportation distance of dredged material to the final treatment or disposal facility\nis an important consideration for short-term effectiveness. Distances were estimated in\nthe FS for the purposes of comparing options and developing costs. Options E (on-Site\nstabilization and on-Site beneficial use) and G (on-Site stabilization and disposal in an\non-Site CDF) do not require the dredged sediment to be transported off-Site, although\nstabilization reagents (e.g., cement and blast furnace slag) would need to be\ntransported to the on-Site facility. Of the remaining disposal options, Option F (off-Site\nstabilization and disposal in an on-Site CDF) offers the shortest transport distance for\nthe dredged sediment (approximately 60 nautical miles round trip), all of it by barge.\nDisposal Option A (thermal treatment) consists of approximately 30 nautical miles of\nbarge transport from the Site to the off-Site-dredge-material-processing facility and\nfrom there approximately 60 miles of transport by truck to the thermal treatment facility.\n74\nThe transport distance for Option B (off-Site landfill) is estimated to be approximately\n30 nautical miles by barge to the processing facility and then approximately 110 miles\nby truck to a disposal facility. Option C (cogeneration) is estimated to include\napproximately 30 nautical miles of transport to the processing facility and\napproximately 350 miles by truck to the cogeneration plant used as the example\nfacility. The off-Site beneficial use for sediment under Option D has been assumed to\nbe landfill daily cover; thus, it has been assumed that the material would need to be\ntransported approximately 110 miles by truck from the off-Site stabilization facility to the\ndisposal facility.\nContaminated CSO solids controls in the form of retention tanks can be designed,\nconstructed and operated in a manner that does not present short-term implementation\nrisks to the community and workers, manages environmental impacts and meets\nARARs.\nIdeally, contaminated CSO solids control would be in place before the implementation\nof the remedy for canal sediments. Alternatively, temporary CSO control measures\nmay be needed to maintain remedy protectiveness while the permanent contaminated\nCSO solids controls are being implemented. At the time of the completion of the canal\nremedy, the canal surface would be “clean,” with surface sediment contaminant\nconcentrations expected to increase over time as a result of new sediment deposition\nin the canal. However, as noted, the CSO control design criteria would be selected\nsuch that the deposition of solids from CSOs would not result in surface sediment\nconcentrations above the RGs.\nIt is estimated that the design and construction of both action alternatives would take\nthree years and six years, respectively.\nImplementability\nAlternative 1 is considered to be readily implementable because no remedial actions\nwould be performed\nBoth Alternatives 5 and 7 would be administratively feasibile in terms of assuring that\nthe off-site treatment/stabilization facilities have the required permits. The dredging\nand capping components of Alternatives 5 and 7 are considered moderately\nimplementable. Both alternatives would require significant coordination between the\nEPA, USACE, NYSDEC, NYCDEP, PRPs and the property owners and tenants along\nthe canal from the start of the design through completion of construction. The specific\ncharacteristics of the canal (e.g., debris, degraded bulkheads, space limitations and the\nsurrounding lively metropolitan residential and commercial community) and the large\nvolumes of capping materials required would pose challenges to the remedy\nimplementation. The amount of material required for the cap construction may require\n75\nusing several vendors, advanced planning and stockpiling material in advance of the\nconstruction to assure that enough material is available during the implementation\nperiod. It is anticipated that appropriate planning and engineering measures can\naddress these issues. Alternative 5 is considered to have moderate overall\nimplementability. Because there are more uncertainties associated with the ISS\ncomponent of Alternative 7 and additional treatability and pilot testing are required to\nconfirm the overall feasibility and effectiveness of this technology, Alternative 7 is\nconsidered to have moderate implementability, but to a lesser degree than Alternative\n5. The location and construction of a temporary on-Site sediment handling and\ndewatering facility is considered to have moderate implementability.\nThe implementability of the different treatment and disposal options is more variable:\n Option A (off-Site thermal desorption and beneficial use): moderate\n Option B (off-Site land fill disposal): moderate to high\n Option C (off-Site cogeneration and beneficial use): moderate\n Option D (off-Site stabilization and off-Site beneficial use): moderate\n Option E (on-Site stabilization and on-Site beneficial use): moderate\n Option F (off-Site stabilization and disposal in on-Site constructed CDF): moderate\n Option G (on-Site stabilization and disposal in on-Site constructed CDF): moderate\nThermal treatment and cogeneration facilities (Options A and C, respectively) are\nlimited within the geography, which would restrict the ability to competitively bid these\nservices. The total PCB and lead concentrations in the soft sediment in some portions\nof the canal may also limit the potential for beneficial use after thermal treatment.\nTreatability testing would be needed to confirm that the available treatment facilities\ncan accept the dewatered and stabilized sediment.\nThe availability of landfill facilities that would accept contaminated river sediment as\nwaste and the existing capacity at these facilities within the geography is limited. Based\non inquiries of Subtitle D landfills in the area, few facilities would accept materials\noriginating from outside the county they serve and only a subset of these facilities\nwould accept dredged material. Because Option B includes off-Site landfill disposal of\nthe stabilized dredged sediment, the implementability of this option is reduced for\ndisposal facilities in the area; however, additional disposal facilities are available\noutside of the area. Use of these facilities would result in increased transport costs.\nThe beneficial use of treated sediment under Options A and C is expected to be readily\nimplementable as long as treated sediment meets the end-use requirements.\nThe implementation of Options D and E (stabilization and beneficial use) would require\nidentifying an off-Site or on-Site beneficial use of the stabilized material, as well as\ndefining the performance standards for the end-use requirements. The stabilized\nmaterial would need to meet the chemical and physical performance standards (e.g.,\n76\nshort- and long-term leachability and strength characteristics) in order for these options\nto be implemented. Additionally, on-Site use of the stabilized material would be\ndependent upon property owner acceptance and the sustained application of\ninstitutional controls. Due to these unknowns and challenges, these two disposal\noptions are considered to have moderate implementability. The off-Site beneficial-use\noption has a slightly higher ranking due to the possibility of more beneficial-use\napplications. The on-Site beneficial-use option also is ranked slightly lower due to the\npotential difficulties associated with effective sustained implementation of institutional\ncontrols.\nImplementation of disposal Options F and G (stabilization and on-Site CDF) is\ndependent on the acceptance from the community, review of NYSDEC and other\nappropriate governmental regulatory authorities and the sustained application of\ninstitutional controls. These options may be difficult to implement due to administrative\nconsiderations and, therefore, received a moderate ranking.\nVarious approaches to CSO solids control exist and have been successfully\nimplemented elsewhere. NYCDEP has demonstrated that CSO discharges can be\nsignificantly reduced with the utilization of CSO retention tanks.\nCost\nA summary of the estimated cost for each dredging and capping alternative and the\nassociated treatment and disposal options, as well as the costs for the CSO retention\ntanks, is provided in Table 16.\nSupport Agency Acceptance\nNYSDEC concurs with the selected remedy; a letter of concurrence is attached (see\nAppendix IV).\nCommunity Acceptance\nComments received during the public comment period indicate that the public generally\nsupports the dredging, capping and CSO abatement components of the selected\nremedy. While 15 local businesses and approximately 700 Red Hook residents located\nin close proximity to the proposed location of the CDF expressed support for its\nconstruction, approximately 900 parties located in other sections of Red Hook,\nelsewhere in New York State and in other states expressed strong opposition to the\nCDF option. In addition, two petitions containing over 3,000 signatures from business\nowners, residents, users of the recreation area, and concerned citizens expressing\nopposition to the processing of contaminated sediments in Red Hook and their\nplacement in a CDF was presented to the EPA by “No Toxic Red Hook.” The\n77\ncomments are summarized and addressed in the Responsiveness Summary, which is\nattached as Appendix V to this document.\nPRINCIPAL THREAT WASTE\nThe NCP establishes an expectation that the EPA will use treatment to address the\nprincipal threats posed by a site wherever practicable (NCP Section 300.430\n(a)(1)(iii)(A)). The Aprincipal threat@ concept is applied to the characterization of\nAsource materials@ at a Superfund site. A source material is material that includes or\ncontains hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants that acts as a reservoir for\nthe migration of contamination to groundwater, surface water or air, or acts as a\nsource for direct exposure. Principal threat wastes are those source materials\nconsidered to be highly toxic or highly mobile and that generally cannot be reliably\ncontained or will present a significant risk to human health or the environment should\nexposure occur. The decision to treat these wastes is made on a site-specific basis\nthrough a detailed analysis of alternatives, using the remedy-selection criteria that are\ndescribed below. This analysis provides a basis for making a statutory finding that the\nremedy employs treatment as a principal element.\nElevated contaminant concentrations and visual evidence of the presence of NAPL\nexist in the canal. The RI indicated that the NAPL and contaminated sediments are\nmobile, at least when disturbed; have high concentrations of toxic compounds; and\npresent significant risks. Therefore, they are characterized as principal threat wastes.\nThe selected remedy addresses source materials constituting principal threats by\nremoving the entire accumulated sediment column, thermally treating the NAPL-\nimpacted sediments dredged from the upper and mid-reaches of the canal and\napplying ISS in targeted NAPL areas of native sediment, thereby satisfying the\npreference for treatment.\nSELECTED REMEDY\nSummary of the Rationale for the Selected Remedy\nBased upon consideration of the requirements of CERCLA, the results of the Site\ninvestigations, the detailed analysis of the alternatives and public comments, the EPA\nhas determined that the following combination of alternatives44 and treatment and\ndisposal options satisfies the requirements of CERCLA Section 121, 42 U.S.C. § 9621,\nand provides the best balance of tradeoffs among the remedial alternatives with\nrespect to the NCP’s nine evaluation criteria at 40 CFR §300.430(e)(9):\n44 While remedial alternatives are typically compared against each other with the intent of\nselecting one alternative, due to the different conditions at each of the RTAs, both action\nalternatives will be utilized.\n78\n Alternative 5: Dredge the entire soft sediment column and cap with treatment,\nisolation and armor layers for RTA 3.\n Alternative 7: Dredge the entire soft sediment column, targeted ISS of native\nsediment in areas with potential for active upward NAPL migration from the\nnative sediment and cap with treatment, isolation and armor layers for RTAs 1\nand 2.\n Excavation and restoration of a portion of the original filled-in 1st Street turning\nbasin.\n Excavation and restoration of the portion of the 5th Street turning basin\nbeginning underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and extending approximately 25\nfeet to the east and the installation of a barrier or interception system at the\neastern boundary of the excavation.\n Option A: Off-Site thermal desorption/beneficial use for the sediments removed\nfrom the NAPL-impacted areas in RTA 1 and RTA 2.\n Option D: Off-Site stabilization/beneficial use for the sediments removed from\nthe non-NAPL impacted areas in RTA 3.\n Contaminated CSO solids control through the use of CSO retention tanks.\nThe rationale for selecting this remedy is as follows:\n Removal of all of the soft sediment will remove the PAHs and collocated metals and\nPCBs which are found only in the soft sediment at concentrations of concern and is\nthe most appropriate approach to address the principal threat waste (i.e., NAPL\npresent within the accumulated sediments).\n Removal of all soft sediment will limit the potential for future contaminant transport\nthrough localized portions of the cap that might be eroded.\n With the removal of all soft sediment, sediment stabilization will be needed only in\nselect areas where the native sediment is contaminated with NAPL so as to control\nNAPL mobility, and will provide additional partial treatment of this residual principal\nthreat waste\n The native sediment will provide higher long-term reliability for supporting the cap\nthan would placing the cap directly on the soft sediment.\n Removal of the soft sediment removes the high organic carbon content sediment\nfrom the canal that is the likely cause of ebullition, which is a significant NAPL\ntransport mechanism, thereby minimizing the gas buildup under the cap that could\nlead to cap failure.\n If the soft sediment were left in place, stabilization of the soft sediment might be\nneeded to provide the needed cap support along the entire canal, rather than only\nin areas of NAPL mobility in native sediment; widespread stabilization may alter\ngroundwater flow and/or result in localized flooding and will require removal of\nswelled material produced during the stabilization process for disposal.\n Removal of the soft sediment will provide for deeper water depths to support current\n79\nnavigation uses and will better protect the cap and prevent damages from barges.\n Removal of much of the soft sediment is necessary for implementation of the\nremedy and future maintenance of the remedy and canal infrastructure, such as\nbulkheads.\n Removal of the soft sediment will limit the risk of future contaminant transport\ncaused by storm-related cap damage.\n Off-Site thermal desorption of the dredged NAPL-impacted sediments from RTA 1\nand RTA 2 is irreversible and would eliminate the toxicity and mobility of the\ncontaminants in the sediments.\n The utilization of the non-NAPL impacted stabilized sediments dredged from RTA 3\nas off-Site landfill daily cover would provide a beneficial use for the sediments in a\ncontrolled, monitored environment.\n CSO retention tanks and the permitting or elimination of unpermitted pipes will\nprevent recontamination of the canal bottom.\nThe primary reason for the removal of the accumulated soft sediment is the removal\nand treatment of the principal threat waste represented by the grossly-contaminated\naccumulated sediments. Removal of the accumulated sediments will result in the\nremoval of contaminants of concern in that stratum, thereby reducing the risk of\nrecontamination in the event of a cap failure. In addition, the removal of the majority of\nthe accumulated sediments is necessary for constructability reasons. Nearly half of the\nsoft sediment must be removed to create sufficient depth for work boats that will\nimplement the remedy (debris removal, installing/removing temporary sheet-pilings,\ndredging, disposal barges and cap placement), to maintain the cap and conduct future\nrepairs to bulkheads and other infrastructure throughout the canal and to avoid\npropeller wash cap damage by existing commercial barge navigation in the lower two\nthirds of the canal.\nCurrent and expected major development projects in the area will likely bring\nsubstantially more people to upland portions of the canal, adding to the number of\npeople subject to the identified exposure pathways. NYC has previously identified such\nredevelopment pressures as justification for the timely implementation of a remedy.\nThe EPA believes that the remedy can be initiated after approximately three years of\ndesign work, and would be implemented within six years of initiation.\nThe EPA has determined and NYSDEC agrees that the selected remedy is protective\nof human health and the environment, provides the greatest long-term effectiveness, is\nable to achieve ARARs more quickly than other alternatives and is cost-effective. The\nselected remedy utilizes permanent solutions, alternative treatment technologies and\nresource-recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable. Furthermore, the\nselected remedy meets the statutory preference for the use of treatment as a principal\nelement.\n80\nDescription of the Selected Remedy\nThe selected remedy includes dredging of accumulated sediments, capping, off-Site\nthermal treatment of dredged NAPL-impacted sediments in the canal and existing\nturning basins, in-situ stabilization of native sediments with high levels of NAPL,\nexcavation and restoration of a portion of the filled-in former 1st Street and a portion of\nthe 5th Street turning basin beginning underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge, stabilization of\nsediments not impacted by NAPL and reuse off-Site, institutional controls and\ncombined sewer overflow controls.45 The specific components of the selected remedy\nare as follows:\nDredging, Capping and Treatment/Disposal\nBecause of the substantial amounts of debris in the canal and in order to facilitate the\ndredging of the contaminated sediment, debris removal from the canal bottom will be\ncompleted prior to the commencement of the dredging.\nRTAs 1 and 2: Alternative 7 (dredge entire soft sediment column, targeted ISS of\nnative sediment in areas with potential for active upward NAPL migration from the\nnative sediment and cap with treatment, isolation and armor layers). The armor layer\nwill consist of stone sized to meet the erosion forces of the flushing tunnel and\nnavigation impacts. Sufficient sand will be placed on top of the armor layer to fill in the\nvoids between the stones and to establish sufficient depth of soft sediment in order to\nfacilitate benthic recolonization.\nRTA 3: Alternative 5 (dredge entire soft sediment column and cap with treatment,\nisolation and armor layers).\nAlthough the FS report used mechanical dredging as the representative method of\nsediment removal, flexibility will be allowed in the selection of the most appropriate\ndredging method during the remedial design.\nThe remedy will also include the excavation and restoration of approximately 475 feet\nof the filled-in former 1st Street turning basin and the excavation and restoration of the\nportion of the 5th Street turning basin beginning underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and\nextending approximately 25 feet to the east, and the installation of a barrier or\ninterception system at the eastern boundary of the excavation.46 In addition to the\n45 See Figure 6 for an illustration of the selected remedy.\n46 Analytical data obtained during the RI in the former 1st Street turning basin showed the\nexistence of significant contamination in soil and groundwater above cleanup standards. As\nwith other former turning basins along the canal, it is believed that contaminated sediments\nwithin the 1st Street turning basin were left in place when it was filled in. In addition, there\n81\nremoval of buried contaminated sediments which are ongoing contaminant source to\nthe canal, the excavation of the turning basins will mitigate the loss of surface water\narea as a result of new bulkhead encroachment into the canal.\nAddressing the contaminated sediments will remove PAHs and the other collocated\nrisk-driving chemicals (PCBs and metals).\nApproximately 307,000 CY of contaminated sediment would be dredged from RTA 1\nand RTA 2 and approximately 281,000 CY of contaminated sediment would be\ndredged from RTA 3.\nThe cap would need to be designed to tolerate future maintenance dredging operations\nin the canal for the removal of contaminated solids that might settle on top of it. The\nspecific type of the treatment layer will be selected during the remedial design, taking\ninto consideration technological advances. If practicable, the treatment layer\ncomponent of the cap will be designed to have an adequate life expectancy for\nabsorbing NAPL without replacement. For areas with high NAPL or impacted\ngroundwater discharge, treatment gates will likely be needed where the treatment\nmedia can be removed without disturbing the cap outside these areas.\nPilot testing will be performed to assess whether or not large-scale ISS of NAPL-\nimpacted native sediments will have an adverse impact on groundwater flow and to\nprovide information for the design of mitigation measures if results indicate that\nadverse impacts are expected.\nFollowing on-Site dewatering, the disposition of the dredged sediments will be as\nfollows:\nRTA 1: NAPL Impacted Areas, Option A—Off-Site thermal desorption/beneficial use;\nNon-NAPL Impacted Areas, Option D—Off-Site stabilization/beneficial use.\nRTA 2: Option A—Off-Site thermal desorption/beneficial use (NAPL impacts throughout\nRTA 2).\nRTA 3: Option D—Off-Site stabilization/beneficial use.\nPeriodic maintenance of the cap and long-term monitoring will be performed to insure\nare indications that the fill itself may have included waste materials. The filled-in 1st Street\nturning basin may also have been subject to later spills and dumping. The turning basin is\nhydraulically connected to the canal (with no bulkhead standing between the canal and the\nbasin) such that contaminants within the basin are an on-going source of contamination.\nFinally, unlike the filled in portions of the other former turning basins (with the exception of\nthe portion of the 4th Street turning basin located underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge), the 1st\nStreet turning basin has no standing structures on or near it.\n82\nthat the remedy continues to function effectively. The frequency and specific details of\nthe maintenance and monitoring programs will be developed during the remedial\ndesign.\nSource Controls\nIn order for the selected remedy in the canal to be effective, sources that could\nrecontaminate the canal must be addressed. The upland sources of contamination,\nincluding the former MGP facilities, the CSO discharges in the upper part of the canal\n(particularly, outfalls RH-034 and OH-007), contaminated areas along the canal\n(including contaminated solids contributed by erosion from the surface and through\nbulkheads in disrepair) and the unpermitted pipes along the canal will be addressed\nprior to the commencement of, or in phased coordination with, the implementation of\nthe selected remedy.\nThe former MGP facilities are being addressed by National Grid under NYSDEC\noversight. Based upon the first NYSDEC-selected remedy at one of these sites and\nNYSDEC guidance for presumptive remedies at former MGP facilities, it is assumed\nthat actions such as removal of mobile sources, construction of cut-off walls along the\ncanal, and active recovery of NAPL near the cut-off walls for each of the former MGP\nfacilities will be implemented to prevent the migration of contamination from the former\nMGP facilities into the canal. The cleanup of the former MGP facilities will be\ncompleted in accordance with schedules agreed upon between the EPA and NYSDEC\n(see Appendix VI). In the unlikely event that a timely and effective state-selected\nremedy is not implemented at a given former MGP facility, the EPA may implement\nactions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure the protectiveness of the selected remedy.\nNYSDEC is currently overseeing work being performed by NYCDEP to reduce CSOs\nto the canal by approximately 34 percent in lower canal outfalls. Additional long-term\nCSO reductions are anticipated result from the NYCDEP sewer separation project for\nflood control purposes in a 96-acre area around Carroll Street, and from the NYCDEP\ngreen infrastructure effort (however, the stormwater component of the CSOs will still\ndischarge to the canal after the sewer separation project). To significantly reduce\noverall contaminated solid discharges to the canal, the selected remedy includes the\nfollowing CSO control measures for the upper reach of the canal:\n Construction of in-line sewage/stormwater retention tanks in the vicinity of\noutfalls RH-034 and OH-007. It is estimated that an 8-million gallon tank and a\n4-million gallon tank will be required for outfalls RH-34 and OH-007,\nrespectively. In addition, smaller CSOs in the vicinity of outfalls RH-034 and\nOH-007 will be connected to the retention tanks. The location and capacity of\nthe retention tanks will be determined during the remedial design. The capacity\nof the retention tanks will need to accommodate the projected additional loads\n83\nto the combined sewer system as a result of current and future residential\ndevelopment, as well as a result of periods of high rainfall, including future\nrainfall increases that may result from climate change. The retention tanks will\nalso need to conform with the requirements of the CWA and work in concert\nwith NYC’s wastewater treatment plants.\n In the event that the permanent measures described above are not\nimplemented in a timely manner, implementation of interim controls, such as\ntemporary solids capture and removal, to mitigate sediment from the CSO\ndischarges until the permanent measures have been implemented. 47\nSince the EPA is incorporating contaminated CSO solids control in the remedy\nselection, siting, remedial design and remedial action, pursuant to the authority of\nCERCLA, certain CERCLA statutory authorities including, but not limited to, permit\nexemption and environmental impact statement functional equivalency apply. The EPA\nseeks to coordinate the CERCLA and CWA processes to the extent practicable, to\nensure that the selected CERCLA remedy is implemented in an effective and timely\nmanner.\nThe selected remedy also includes the following measures for discharges from upland\nSites (other than the former MGP facilities) and for unpermitted pipes along the canal:\n The EPA and NYSDEC will coordinate measures to control discharges from\nupland contaminated areas adjacent to the canal that have already been\nreferred to NYSDEC for action. The schedule for these measures will conform\nto the schedules for the cleanup of the canal.\n Under the selected remedy, unpermitted pipe outfalls will be either controlled or\neliminated.\nIt is anticipated that temporary sheet-piling will be required for dredging and capping in\nlocations where the condition of bulkheads warrants additional structural support. At\nthe former MGP facilities, bulkhead replacement will likely be a component of the\nremedy. Other areas where significant NAPL is found at shallow depths in the banks of\nthe canal may also require bulkhead replacement in conjunction with construction of\nsubsurface barrier walls. Elsewhere, it is anticipated that bulkhead replacement will not\nbe part of the remedy, unless a substandard bulkhead is judged to present an\nimpediment to construction or a threat to the integrity of the remedy. Based on the\nanticipated interception walls for the former MGP facility cleanups and the EPA’s\ncurrent negotiations with various property owners along the canal for bulkhead\nupgrades, the EPA anticipates that a significant portion of the existing bulkheads will be\nupgraded to a standard before dredging so as to not require temporary shoring.\n47 It is unlikely that permanent measures to control the CSO discharges will be in place before\nthe commencement of the remediation of the canal sediments.\n84\nA temporary on-Site facility may be necessary for dewatering, water treatment and/or\ntransfer of dredged sediments. To the extent practicable, such operations may take\nplace on barges.\nBarges will be used for the transport of dredged sediment. The use of barges and other\nproject-related watercraft (for sampling, support, etc.) during project operations will\nimpact the use of other commercial and recreational water-based traffic on the canal.\nThe EPA will establish plans to mitigate such impacts, though these impacts cannot be\neliminated. Appropriate measures will be taken to limit noise, odors and other impacts\nassociated with dredging and processing of the sediments. The EPA will continue to\nconduct community outreach to involve and inform the public and address public\nconcerns during the design and implementation of the remedy.\nCurrent and future high density residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal\nand within the sewershed shall adhere to NYC rules for sewer connections (Chapter\n31 of Title 15 of the Rules of the City of New York) and shall be consistent with current\nNYCDEP criteria (NYCDEP, 2012) and guidelines to ensure that hazardous\nsubstances and solids from additional sewage loads do not compromise the\neffectiveness of the permanent CSO control measures by exceeding their design\ncapacity. For example, redevelopment projects will need to take mitigation measures\nto prevent or offset additional sewer loadings. Separated stormwater outfalls will also\nrequire engineering controls to ensure that hazardous substances and solids are not\ndischarged to the canal.\nPilot projects supported by federal and NYC grants are currently under way for the\ncontrol of street runoff along the Gowanus Canal using green street ends.48\nThe environmental benefits of the selected remedy may be enhanced by\nconsideration, during the design, of technologies and practices that are sustainable in\naccordance with the EPA Region 2’s Clean and Green Energy Policy and NYSDEC’s\nGreen Remediation Policy.49 This will include consideration of green remediation\ntechnologies and practices.\nBecause this remedy will result in contaminants remaining on-Site above levels that\nallow for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure, CERCLA requires that the Site be\nreviewed at least once every five years after the initiation of the action.\n48 Green street ends employ vegetation planted between the end of the street and the canal to\nprevent particulate matter and oils from discharging into the canal. The EPA supports the\nexpanded use of such green street ends.\n49 See http://epa.gov/region2/superfund/green_remediation and http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/\nremediation_hudson_pdf/der31.pdf.\n85\nAs was noted in the “Scope and Role of the Operable Unit” section, above,\ncontaminated groundwater that is migrating to the canal from upland areas will be\ninvestigated and addressed as part of the upland source remediation, as necessary.\nInstitutional Controls\nInstitutional controls are part of the selected remedy. Because of the anticipated\nunacceptable human health risk associated with the consumption of PCB-contaminated\nfish and shellfish after the remedy is implemented, the EPA will rely on existing New\nYork State Department of Health (NYSDOH) fish consumption advisories. This existing\nfish consumption advisory for Upper New York Bay identifies PCBs as one of the\ncontaminants of concern.\nInstitutional controls will also be used to protect the integrity of the cap and in-situ\nstabilized material. NYC owns the canal (with the exception of certain turning basins)\nand is among the government entities that regulates bulkhead construction. The\ninstitutional controls will include restrictions to prevent damage to the cap, limitations\non construction within the canal, including bulkhead maintenance and navigation\ndredging within the canal. Where cutoff walls and other upland cleanup measures are\nimplemented under NYSDEC or EPA oversight, appropriate protective easements or\nother deed restrictions would be implemented.\nSummary of the Estimated Remedy Costs\nThe estimated capital cost is $285,700,000. The estimated treatment and disposal\ncost is $216,000,000. The estimated annual operation, maintenance and monitoring\ncost (using the federal standard seven percent discount rate and a 30-year interval) is\n$4,400,000 (the cost includes O&M related to the in-line retention tanks). The\nestimated present-worth cost is $506,100,000. Tables 17 and 18 provide the basis for\nthe cost estimates for the selected remedy.\nIt should be noted that these cost estimates are order-of-magnitude engineering cost\nestimates that are expected to be within +50 to -30 percent of the actual project cost.\nThese cost estimates are based on the best available information regarding the\nanticipated scope of the selected remedy. Changes in the cost elements are likely to\noccur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design\nof the remedy.\nExpected Outcomes of the Selected Remedy\nThe results of the HHRA indicate that the canal, if left unremediated, presents\nunacceptable risk levels for surface water/sediment contact and fish consumption.\nHuman exposure to hazardous substances in surface water and surface sediment by\n86\nrecreating adults, adolescents and children may result in carcinogenic risks above the\nEPA’s target risk range. These risks are associated primarily with exposure to\ncarcinogenic PAHs in the surface water and the surface sediment. Human exposure to\nsurface water and surface sediment from canal overflow may result in carcinogenic\nrisks above the EPA’s target risk range.\nDespite a New York State Department of Health fish advisory covering the entire\nGowanus Canal, posted warnings and public outreach efforts, the canal is regularly\nused for fishing, particularly subsistence fishing by communities surrounding the canal\nwith environmental justice concerns. A NYCDEP survey of residents indicated that\nfishing is the number one canal use by area residents (NYCDEP 2008). The EPA\nbelieves that the selected remedy will reduce risks to these communities by reducing\nsources which contribute to these risks. However, because the selected remedy will not\nfully eliminate the need for fishing advisories due to contaminants from New York\nHarbor, the EPA intends to continue to coordinate fishing advisory education and\nawareness efforts with the appropriate governmental agencies.\nThe key results of the BERA indicated that PAHs, PCBs and metals in the sediment\nare toxic to benthic organisms. PAHs were detected in sediment at the highest\nconcentrations relative to their ecological screening benchmarks and represent the\ngreatest Site-related risk to the benthic community. PCBs and seven metals (barium,\ncadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and silver) were also detected at\nconcentrations above their ecological screening benchmarks and at concentrations\nsignificantly higher than those detected in reference area sediments and also represent\na potential Site-related risk to the benthic community. PAHs were found to be a\npotential risk to aquatic herbivores (represented by the black duck) and mercury was\nfound to be a potential risk to avian omnivores (represented by the heron).\nThe selected remedy will reduce the above-noted risks by reducing sources which\ncontribute to these risks.\nImplementation of the selected remedy will improve the surface water quality of the\nGowanus Canal by controlling and substantially eliminating sheens and preventing\ncontact of the surface water with the contaminated sediment.\nIt is estimated that it will require six years to construct the selected remedy and achieve\nthe RAOs.\nSource Control\nThe coordination of upland cleanups, CSO control and the sediment remedy is\nnecessary for a comprehensive and sustainable remedy.\n87\nWith respect to the former MGP facilities and other upland source areas, the EPA and\nNYSDEC are closely coordinating and the EPA is confident that these source areas\ncan be appropriately addressed within the anticipated remedial approach and schedule\nfor the canal remedy.\nThe EPA and NYSDEC have agreed to a coordinated schedule for the former MGP\nfacilities and canal sediment cleanup efforts based on the anticipated timing of the\ndredging in the canal (which will commence at the head of the canal).\nBecause the upland contamination source areas which may impact groundwater have\nbeen referred to NYSDEC for investigation and remediation, if necessary, the EPA\nbelieves that a groundwater remedy is not required as part of this remedy. As a result,\nthe selected remedy will not rely on dilution or dispersion of contaminated groundwater\nwhich is discharging into the canal.\nCSO controls are needed to prevent the discharge and transport of contaminated CSO\nsolids which are contaminated with comparatively low levels of hazardous substances\nassociated with urban CSO discharges. These solids also serve to capture and\nconcentrate other contaminants. Such controls will ensure the long-term viability of a\nrestored canal.\nAs noted in the “Site Background” section, above, a number of planned sewer system\nimprovements will decrease the overall CSO discharges to the canal. As a result, the\nEPA does not foresee a need for additional CSO controls in the lower reaches of the\ncanal, where all of the reductions will occur from the CSO control improvements now\nunderway. Although the WB/WS Plan will achieve an overall estimated 34 percent\nreduction of CSOs to the canal, discharges at outfall RH-034 at the head of the canal\nare estimated by NYCDEP to increase by 5 percent. Planned development in the area\nhas the potential to increase sewage flows further, which can contribute to increases in\nCSO discharges.\nThe selected remedy will not be inconsistent with the LTCP and the CWA. The canal’s\ncurrent uses, fishing and recreation, and the physical conditions which lead to frequent\nflooding with the potential to distribute sediments and sewage contaminated with\nhazardous substances, provide a further basis for implementing additional\ncontaminated CSO solids controls. Significant residential and commercial\nredevelopment pressures that exist adjacent to the canal increase the need for\nsediment, upland and CSO remedy components. However, new construction would be\nsubject to NYC building codes and stormwater rules, updated in 2012, which would\nhelp reduce the impacts of such development.\nThe EPA is committed to achieving cost savings by working closely with NYCDEP to\naccomplish an effective Superfund cleanup while also realizing CSO benefits\n88\nnecessary to effectively implement the remedy through synergies and economies of\nscale. NYCDEP will complete a full assessment of achieving CWA goals with\nsubmission of the LCTP pursuant to the CSO Consent Order. The LTCP, which is due\nto the State in June 2015, is expected to address, at a minimum, the EPA’s remedial\nperformance goals for further contaminated CSO solids control in the upper reach of\nthe canal.\nThe design of this Superfund remedy will be informed by NYC’s contemporaneous\nwork in developing the LTCP. The EPA will work with NYC to advance both Superfund\nand CWA goals by allowing NYCDEP the opportunity to evaluate locating CSO control\nfacilities in areas where upland Site-related source removal work might take place,\ncreating a synergy between programs that potentially could save time in Site\nacquisition and permitting and save significant construction costs. While final selection\nof the CSO control locations will occur during the remedial design, the EPA has\nidentified the western two-thirds of Thomas Greene Park and the NYC Department of\nTransportation storage lot located at 2nd Avenue and 5th Street (which is adjacent to\nthe sewage system infrastructure) as potentially suitable locations due to such\nsynergies. Both are owned by NYC, eliminating property acquisition costs. Both\nparcels are located near the major CSO outfalls, RH-034 and OH-007, which require\ncontrol.\nThomas Greene Park is part of the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site. Gas\nstorage tanks and other operations were located on the parcels from 1879 until\napproximately 1938. The coal tar at this parcel and surrounding parcels is a major\nongoing source of NAPL to the canal. As an owner of the park, NYC may also be\nconsidered liable for its remediation. The eastern third of the park, where no\ncontamination is present, was renovated in 2012-2013. National Grid’s RI Report\nindicates that the western two-thirds of the park contains high levels of MGP\ncontamination at depths of 8 feet or more below the ground surface. Although the RI\nfound that contamination poses no risk to current users of the park, any future\nrenovation project in this area that involved extensive excavation would encounter\nMGP contaminated soils, and in some places could encounter soils with free liquid tar.\nAlthough NYSDEC has not yet selected a remedy for the former Fulton MGP facility,\nsuch remedial work on or near the park would be expected to cause temporary\ndisruptions to public use of the park. In the event that excavation of NAPL source\nareas is necessary at the park, co-location of a CSO retention tank would potentially\nreduce the costs of both the MGP facility cleanup and the tank construction. Based on\nother existing CSO retention tank projects, the EPA believes that CSO controls can be\nintegrated into both of the potential tank locations while maintaining their current uses.\nSince the EPA is incorporating contaminated CSO solids control in the remedy\nselection, siting, remedial design and remedial action pursuant to the authority of\nCERCLA, certain CERCLA statutory authorities including, but not limited to, permit\n89\nexemption and environmental impact statement functional equivalency apply. The EPA\nseeks to coordinate the CERCLA and CWA processes to the extent practicable, to\nensure that the selected CERCLA remedy is implemented in an effective and timely\nmanner.\nRemedy Considerations--Bulkhead Replacement\nThe condition and appearance of the bulkheads is a matter of significant concern to\naffected property owners and the public. The cost of temporary shoring of bulkheads is\nincluded in the selected remedy. Only limited permanent bulkhead replacement is\nexpected to occur as a direct part of the remedy. Other bulkhead replacement is\nexpected to occur as a result of remedial work conducted by National Grid under\nNYSDEC oversight, and through re-development projects such as by the Lightstone\nGroup and other developers, as well as via upgrades by private property owners. To\nfacilitate each of these approaches, the EPA has held talks with the USACE, NYSDEC\nand NYC about cooperative approaches to address bulkhead replacement and\nrestoration along the canal. To the extent that bulkhead replacement occurs,\nappropriate consideration will be given to bulkhead preservation, aesthetics and the\nuse of soft edges. The restoration effort at the two turning basins will mitigate the loss\nof surface water area as a result of new bulkhead encroachment into the canal.\nThe EPA is developing a standard approach which will ensure that the bulkheads are\nupgraded in a manner consistent with the canal remedy and the substantive\nrequirements of NYSDEC and other agencies. This includes a standardized design,\npromoting coordination among interested owners to reduce their costs through\neconomies of scale, and application of the CERCLA permit exemption. The EPA has\nmet with several property owners who are interested in replacing their properties’\nbulkheads. It is expected that bulkhead replacement would be conducted under an\nappropriate settlement agreement with EPA oversight.\nThe EPA believes that there are a moderate number of locations where bulkheads are\nso deteriorated that they may fail when the temporary sheet-piling is removed after\ndredging. In such cases, the EPA intends to cooperate with NYC on inspection and\nenforcement of existing NYC bulkhead maintenance requirements and seek to reduce\ncosts for affected bulkhead owners through use of the EPA’s standardized approach\nfor design and construction.\nWhile the EPA will continue working with all of the stakeholders, it recognizes that it is\nnot possible to insure that all of the bulkheads that need to be replaced will be\nreplaced. Therefore, some substandard bulkheads may still remain. If the continued\npresence of such substandard bulkheads is judged to present a threat to the integrity of\nthe canal remedy, available CERCLA authorities and/or resources will be used as\nnecessary to ensure their repair.\n90\nSTATUTORY DETERMINATIONS\nUnder CERCLA Section 121 and the NCP, the lead agency must select remedies that\nare protective of human health and the environment, comply with ARARs (unless a\nstatutory waiver is justified), are cost-effective and utilize permanent solutions and\nalternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum\nextent practicable. Section 121(b)(1) also establishes a preference for remedial\nactions which employ treatment to permanently and significantly reduce the volume,\ntoxicity or mobility of the hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants at a site.\nFor the reasons discussed below, the EPA has determined that the selected remedy\nmeets these statutory requirements.\nProtection of Human Health and the Environment\nThe selected remedy is expected to be protective of human health and the\nenvironment. It will meet the RAOs by removing contaminated soft sediment and\ncapping with an active treatment layer to reduce and control the long-term risks\nassociated with the native sediment. Placing this type of active cap over the\ncontaminated native sediment remaining in the canal will significantly reduce exposure\nto human and ecological receptors, thereby reducing and controlling toxicity to benthic\norganisms and significantly reducing the risks to herbivorous birds. The cap will also\nprevent direct contact with NAPL and prevent NAPL migration to the surface water of\nthe canal.50 Contingent upon the results of bench- and pilot-scale studies to determine\nthe most effective, implementable form of ISS within the canal, the implementation of\nISS in targeted areas is expected to provide additional protectiveness against NAPL\nmigration from the native sediment. In the event that an area of ISS is not fully\neffective, the multilayer cap will provide a redundant level of protectiveness.\nImplementation of the selected remedy will improve the surface water quality of the\nGowanus Canal by controlling and substantially eliminating sheens and preventing\ncontact of the surface water with the contaminated sediment.\nThe upland former MGP facility source controls (and other upland source areas) that\nhave been or are anticipated to be selected by NYSDEC are expected to be protective\nof human health and the environment by controlling the primary source areas and\nminimizing the migration pathways into the canal.\nImplementation of source controls to address CSO-related releases of hazardous\n50 If possible, the treatment layer would be designed to have an adequate life expectancy for\nabsorbing NAPL without replacement. If this is not feasible, the remedy may include the\nreplacement of portions of the treatment layer (replacing the treatment layer would also\nnecessitate the removal and replacement of the overlying sand and armor layers).\n91\nsubstances associated with contaminated CSO solids, beyond those currently being\nimplemented by NYCDEP, is necessary to provide overall protection of human health\nand the environment. In particular, such controls are necessary to protect the integrity\nof the canal remedy. By reducing discharges and accumulation of contaminated CSO\nsolids, contaminant concentrations in surface sediments after remedy implementation\nare expected to meet the cleanup levels, which are considered protective of human\nhealth and the environment. Absent additional controls, solids contaminated with\nhazardous substances will continue to be discharged through the CSOs, affecting\nsediments in the canal. In addition, absent controls, such solids will continue to adsorb\nand concentrate any residual, uncontrolled hazardous substance releases, potentially\nleading to an excursion of the cleanup levels.\nCompliance with ARARs and Other Environmental Criteria\nA summary of the ARARs and AOther Criteria, Advisories or Guidance TBCs@ that will\nbe complied with during implementation of the selected remedy are presented in Table\n19.\nCost-Effectiveness\nA cost-effective remedy is one whose costs are proportional to its overall effectiveness\n(NCP '300.430(f)(1)(ii)(D)). Overall effectiveness is based on the evaluations of the\nfollowing: long-term effectiveness and permanence; reduction in toxicity, mobility and\nvolume through treatment, and short-term effectiveness. Based on the comparison of\noverall effectiveness (discussed above) to cost, the selected remedy meets the\nstatutory requirement that Superfund remedies be cost-effective in that it is the least-\ncostly action alternative and will achieve the remediation goals in the same amount of\ntime in comparison to the more costly alternatives.\nThe relationship of the overall effectiveness of the selected remedy was determined to\nbe proportional to its costs and, hence, this remedy represents a reasonable value for\nthe money to be spent.\nEach of the alternatives underwent a detailed cost analysis. In that analysis, capital\nand annual O&M costs were estimated and used to develop present-worth costs. In\nthe present-worth cost analysis, annual O&M costs were calculated for the estimated\nlife of the groundwater alternatives using a 7% discount rate and a 30-year interval.\nThe estimated capital cost is $285,700,000. The estimated treatment and disposal\ncosts is $216,000,000. The estimated annual operation, maintenance and monitoring\ncosts (using the federal standard 7% discount rate and a 30-year interval) is\n$4,400,000 (the cost includes O&M related to the in-line retention tanks). The\nestimated present-worth cost is $503,700,000.\n92\nUtilization of Permanent Solutions and Alternative Treatment Technologies to\nthe Maximum Extent Practicable\nThe selected remedy provides the best balance of tradeoffs among the alternatives\nwith respect to the balancing criteria set forth in NCP '300.430(f)(1)(i)(B), such that it\nrepresents the maximum extent to which permanent solutions and treatment\ntechnologies can be utilized in a practicable manner at the Site.\nDredging of the contaminated soft sediments, targeted ISS of native sediment in areas\nwith potential for active upward NAPL migration from the native sediment and\nstabilization and thermal treatment of the dredged sediments prior to off-Site disposal\nprovide a permanent remedy and employ treatment technologies to reduce the toxicity,\nmobility and volume of the contaminants.\nPreference for Treatment as a Principal Element\nElevated contaminant concentrations and visual evidence of the presence of NAPL\nexist in the canal. The NAPL and contaminated sediments are mobile, at least when\ndisturbed, have high concentrations of toxic compounds and present significant risks.\nTherefore, they are characterized as principal threat wastes. The EPA’s statutory\npreference for treatment of principal threat materials has been considered as part of\nthis remedy. The selected remedy addresses source materials constituting principal\nthreats by thermally treating the NAPL-impacted sediments dredged from the upper\nand mid-reaches of the canal, and through the application of ISS to targeted NAPL\nareas of native sediment, thereby satisfying the preference for treatment.\nFive-Year Review Requirements\nBecause this remedy will result in hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants\nremaining on Site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure\nto Site media, a statutory review will be conducted within five years after initiation of\nthe remedial action. The five-year review will evaluate the results from monitoring\nprograms established as part of this remedy and developed during the design to\nensure that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.\nDOCUMENTATION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES\nDuring the public comment period, significant concerns were expressed about the\noption of stabilizating the lesser contaminated sediments dredged from RTA 3 and then\nplacing them in an on-Site CDF. As a result of the concerns, this disposal option was\neliminated from consideration. These sediments will be disposed of in the same\nmanner as the RTA 1 non-NAPL impacted area sediments, utilizing Option D under\nwhich the sediments will be stabilized off-Site and beneficially reused to the extent\n93\npossible.\nBased upon suggestions made during the public comment period, the remedy will also\ninclude the excavation and restoration of the portion of the 5th Street turning basin\nbeginning underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and extending approximately 25 feet to\nthe east and the installation of a barrier or interception system at the eastern boundary\nof the excavation. This parcel is a small part of an area that was previously referred\nby the EPA to NYSDEC for investigation as an additional upland source area.\nReferences\nAECOM Consultants. 2009.

EPA will utilize the community involvement activities outlined in this plan to\nensure that residents are continuously informed and provided opportunities to be involved.\nThis Community Involvement Plan addresses the Gowanus Canal’s relationship to the\ncommunity and EPA, provides a background of the community, presents EPA’s community\ninvolvement program, and provides a listing of resources available. EPA drew upon several\ninformation sources to develop this plan, including communicating with community\nmembers and site files. EPA’s Regional Office will oversee the implementation of the\ncommunity involvement activities outlined in this Plan.\n4\nGowanus Canal Superfund Site Map\n5\nSection 2: Site Description\nLocation\nThe Gowanus Canal is a 100-foot wide, 1.8-mile\nlong canal located in the New York City borough of\nBrooklyn, Kings County, New York. The canal is\nconnected to Gowanus Bay in Upper New York\nBay. The canal is surrounded by several residential\nneighborhoods: Gowanus, Cobble Hill, Carroll\nGardens, Park Slope, and Red Hook.\nThere are five bridge crossings over the canal,\nlocated at Union Street, Carroll Street, Third Street,\nNinth Street, and Hamilton Avenue, the Gowanus\nExpressway and the Culver Viaduct of the New\nYork City Subway.\nSource: Community Board 6\nEarly history\nThe Gowanus Canal was originally a tidal creek in the\nsaltwater marsh of western Brooklyn. Local legend has\nit that Dutch farmers named the tidal creek Gowanes\nCreek after Chief Gouwane of the local Lenape tribe.\nThe Gowanus wetlands provided ideal habitat for many\nspecies of fish and other wildlife, of note were the large\noysters that flourished in the brackish water of the\ncreek. In fact it was the Gowanus oyster that became\none of the first exports to Europe by Dutch settlers.\nIn 1776, the Gowanus Creek played a role in\nthe first major battle between the British army\nand American forces of the Revolutionary\nWar. During the Battle of Brooklyn,\nAmerican troops from Maryland held off\nBritish forces at the Old Stone House long\nenough to allow George Washington to retreat\nacross Gowanus Creek. The Marylanders\nsuffered heavy losses and 256 soldiers were\nburied in a field, the gravesite is located at\npresent day Third Avenue between 7th and 8th\nStreets.\nLord Stirling leading an attack against the British at the Old Stone House\n6\nSite History from 1867 to 2010\nBy the mid 1800’s the City of Brooklyn\nhad become the third largest city in\nAmerica. Starting in 1867, the\nGowanus Canal was bulk-headed and\ndredged in order to create a passageway\nthat would allow access for industrial\nneeds. The canal was completed in\n1869, it soon became one of the\nnation’s busiest waterways, supporting\nmanufactured gas plants (MGPs), paint\nand ink factories, coal yards, cement\nmakers, soap makers, tanneries,\nmachine shops, chemical plants, and oil\nrefineries.\nUntreated industrial wastes, raw\nsewage, and surface water emptied into\n1766 map of Brooklyn showing original footprint of the Gowanus\nthe canal and continued for decades\nresulting in the canal becoming one of New York’s most polluted waterways. Although\nmuch of the industrial activity along the canal has stopped, high contaminant levels remain in\nthe sediments. Despite this pollution, some city inhabitants still use the 100-foot-wide, 1.8\nmile long canal for recreation, such as canoeing and diving, while others catch fish at the\nCanal for recreation and consumption.\nGowauns Canal built in 1869 over the original tidal estuary\n7\nIn 1911, New York City\nbuilt a \"Flushing Tunnel\" to\nreplace the stagnant water\nin the canal with fresh,\noxygen-rich water that\nwould improve water\nquality. The tunnel, which\nbrought water in from\nButtermilk Channel,\nworked until the 1960s,\nwhen mechanical failure\ncaused it to shut down and\nthe canal became polluted\nGowanus Canal Flushing Tunnel and Pump Station\nand stagnant again.\nThe New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) subsequently\nrestored and reactivated the Flushing Tunnel in 1999. In 2010, the Flushing Tunnel was shut\ndown by NYCDEP to perform facility improvements. This effort includes the installation of\nmore efficient pumping systems. Completion of the effort is anticipated by September 2014.\nThe reconstruction of the Gowanus Wastewater Pump Station, which began in February\n2010, will increase the pumping capacity to deliver sewage to the Red Hook wastewater\ntreatment plant.\nSampling results have shown\nthat sediments in the\nGowanus Canal are\ncontaminated with a variety\nof pollutants, including\npolycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs),\nvolatile organic compounds\n(VOCs), polychlorinated\nbiphenyls (PCBs), pesticides,\nand metals.\nMany of the detected\nHeavy industrial usage of the Gowanus Canal contaminants are known\ncarcinogens. The\ncontaminated sediments pose\nan immediate risk to the\nfishery located just\nIndustrial activity along the Gowanus Canal\ndownstream of the canal in\n8\nGowanus Bay. This fishery is well\ndocumented, and fish caught there are\nconsumed. Residents have a very high level\nof interest in the Gowanus Canal. Many\ncommunity groups actively supported placing\nthe Gowanus on the NPL.\nIn April 2009, EPA proposed that the\nGowanus Canal be placed on the National\nPriorities List (NPL). The NPL is a published\nlist of hazardous waste sites in the country\nthat are eligible for extensive, long-term\nclean-up actions under the Superfund\nprogram. The site was listed on the NPL on\nManufactured Gas Plant at the Gowanus Canal\nMarch 4, 2010. EPA has identified several\nPotential Responsible Parties (PRPs) and is actively searching for additional PRPs.\nSite Contamination\nThe sediments in the Gowanus Canal are contaminated with a variety of pollutants, including\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\nvolatile organic contaminants (VOAs), and metals. PAH concentrations were found to be as\nhigh as 45,000 milligrams per kilogram (4.5%) and the contamination was found along the\nentire length of the canal. Many of the detected contaminants are known carcinogens. These\ncontaminated sediments pose an immediate threat to the fisheries that are located downstream\nof the canal in the Gowanus Bay.\nContaminants in the canal have been deposited\nGowanus Canal Timeline\nin the canal as a result of current and historical\ndischarge.

The percentage of the population 18 years and over was 80.4%.\nOf the 47,188 households in CD6, 49% were family households, 25% had children under the\nage of 18 living with them and 16% were households with one or more persons 65 years and\nover. The average number family size was 2.93 and the average household size was 2.19.\nNeighborhoods\nRed Hook\nRed Hook is a mixed neighborhood, combining residential areas of both low and high\ndensity with light to heavy areas of industry and manufacturing zones. The\ncommunity is a peninsula that is surrounded by the Gowanus Bay, Erie Basin, and\nButtermilk Channel. Red Hook is traditionally known as a waterfront community and\nstill retains much of its working class characteristics. A majority of the population\nlives in the Red Hook Houses (east and west clusters) that were completed in 1938 as a\nFederal Works Project. (Source: Community Board 6- City of New York)\nCarroll Gardens\nCarroll Gardens is primarily a residential community with a large Italian community, a\nhistorical remnant of the wave of Italians who immigrated in the first part of the 20th\ncentury. Carroll Gardens is bordered by the Gowanus Canal, regional transportation\nthroughways such as the Gowanus Expressway, and Cobble Hill. Carroll Park is the\nmain public space, recreational, and sport area for the community, which caters to both\nthe young and adult population. Organized softball fields bocce leagues, along with\ncommunity events and childcare programs can be found in the park. Recently, the\ncommunity finished construction on a grassy ball field at DiMattina Park. (Source:\nCommunity Board 6- City of New York)\nPark Slope\nPark Slope is the largest neighborhood of the five Community District 6 communities.\nSome of the nation’s best examples of brownstone homes from the late 19th century,\nalong with Brooklyn’s largest historic district, are in Park Slope. In recent years, the\nneighborhood has seen a substantial increase in the number of high end retail shops,\nalong with gourmet restaurants, along 5th and 7th avenue, in the heart of the\ncommunity. Much like Carroll Gardens, the community of Park Slope has become an\nactivist for environmental and civic causes. The community is also host to one of the\n10\nlargest recycling campaigns in the city and leads the in innovative waste management\ntechniques. (Source: Community Board 6- City of New York)\nCobble Hill\nCobble Hill has historically been a residential enclave for professionals. Nearly the\nentire neighborhood centers and is included in the Cobble Hill Historical District\nwhere the preservation of the early 19th century brownstone homes has been extremely\nsuccessful. A large segment of the community is senior citizens, many of which live in\nthe Cobble Hill Health Center. The main park for the community is Cobble Hill Park,\nwhich is mostly restive recreation. However, more active recreation for the youth\noccurs at the three vest-pocket parks that are owned by the Long Island College\nHospitals. Ongoing concerns for the community, like many of district, amount to\ntraffic overflows, noise, and air pollution from the construction on the Gowanus\nExpressway. (Source: Community Board 6- City of New York)\nGowanus\nSoon after the completion of the Gowanus Canal in the 1860s, the area surrounding the\nwaterway became a thriving manufacturing market mostly reliant on the barge service.\nHowever, after the increased use of trucks and the construction of the Gownaus\nExpress shortly after World War II, the canal began a slow and steady decline. With\nthe revamping of the Gowanus Flushing Tunnel and Pump station in 1999, however, a\nbreath of new life has reached the Gowanus community, though many remnants of\nneglect still remain. Many streets and buildings surrounding the canal are in fair-to-\npoor condition, and dead end streets many times act as a magnet for unwelcome\nactivities, such as illegal dumping. Still, hopes remain to attract the community back\ntowards the canal, thereby increasing recreation and street beautification activities.\n(Source: Community Board 6- City of New York)\nEnvironmental Justice\nEPA defines environmental justice (EJ) as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of\nall people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the\ndevelopment, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and\npolicies.\nFair treatment means that no group of people should bear a disproportionate share of\n\nthe negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental and\ncommercial operations or policies.\nMeaningful involvement means that:\n\npeople have an opportunity to participate in decisions about activities that may\n\naffect their environment and/or health;\nthe public’s contribution can influence the regulatory agency’s decision;\n\ntheir concerns will be considered in the decision making process; and\n\n11\nthe decision makers seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially\n\naffected\nBy using readily available environmental and demographic information EPA conducts EJ\nscreening to highlight areas within a community where disproportionate environmental and\nhealth impacts may fall on a low-income and/or racial minority group. EPA’s tool for\nconducting this initial community characterization is called EJSCREEN.\nIn the case of the Gowanus Canal Superfund site, EPA Region 2 examined the environmental\ncharacter of the communities within 1500 meters of the site. EPA looked at the\nenvironmental impacts currently faced by communities with EJ concerns within the study\narea. Several environmental indicators were assessed including exposure to air pollutants,\nlead paint, and exposure to site related contaminants through the consumption of\ncontaminated fish.\nSubsistence fishing takes place along the Columbia Street pier, in Red Hook. The\nconsumption of fish impacted by contamination from the Gowanus Canal superfund site does\nadd an additional environmental burden to communities with EJ concerns. Cleaning up the\nGowanus Canal will greatly reduce the impact of contamination on these fish thereby\nlowering the environmental burden borne by subsistence fishing.\n12\nSection 4: Community Issues and Concerns\nResidents in the communities (Gowanus, Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill and Park\nSlope) have a wide range of knowledge about issues pertaining to the Gowanus Canal.\nCommunity concerns fell into primarily these categories: 1) Environmental, 2) Human\nHealth, 3) Land Use and Development, 4) Archeological Preservation, 5) Population Growth\n6) Technical Information, 7) Employment Opportunities and 8) Environmental Justice.\n1) Environmental\nThe Gowanus Canal has been a highly contaminated water body in this community for\nseveral decades. Residents voiced a variety of environmental concerns regarding the canal\nand clean up.\n CSOs should be addressed as part of a comprehensive cleanup of the canal.\n Water quality should be included as a part of the remediation efforts.\n Any remedy implemented at the canal should ensure that recontamination does not\noccur as a result of CSO and upland sources.\n EPA should consider the impact of sea level rise as part of any remedy.\n A long-term goal in remediating the canal should be to make it fishable and\nswimmable.\n EPA should consider creating soft edges along the length of the canal thereby, creating\nwetlands.\n The canal should be cleaned up completely for the betterment of the environment.\n Toxins form the sediment in the canal could become worse as a result of disturbing\nthem through remediation.\n Cleanup of the canal should not result in an inequitable distribution of the\nenvironmental burden to neighborhoods along the canal\n EPA should consider the impact of hurricanes on the implementation of the remedy.\n Residents in Red Hook expressed concerns that the sediment in the lower portion of\nthe canal may have increased in toxicity post-Hurricane Sandy.\n Concerns were raised that placing a confined disposal facility in a flood zone could\nincrease the risk of environmental disaster for Red Hook.\n2) Human Health\nThe Gowanus Canal is located in a well-populated residential, mixed use and industrial\nsection of Brooklyn. Residents bike, walk and jog across the bridges that traverse the canal\nat Union Street, Carroll Street, 3rd Street and 9th Street. Individuals also canoe; kayak and\nscuba dive in the Canal. Many individuals voiced concerns about the possible health effects\nfrom contamination in the canal.\n Residents would like EPA to conduct a health study to determine the long-term health\neffects of living near the canal.\n13\n Concerns were expressed regarding the health impact of exposure to canal\ncontaminants through recreational use of the canal (e.g. canoeing, kayaking diving,\netc.).\n Residents indicated that they were concerned about the potential health impact of\nexposure to site related contaminants due to flooding.\n Concerns were expressed regarding the health impact of exposure to canal\ncontaminants through fishing and consumption of fish.\n Residents are concerned about the potential of a higher risk of exposure to site related\ncontaminants by living in close proximity to the canal.\n Community representatives are concerned about cancer incidence in the neighborhood\nand the possible link with the canal.\n Concerns were expressed about non-cancer risks that the canal could pose (e.g.\nhepatitis and scoliosis).\n Community residents are concerned about the impact of the clean up on air quality\n(odors), noise levels, and general health impacts on residents.\n Residents would like EPA to implement real time air monitoring at dewatering sites\nand to make this information available to the public.\n Concerns were expressed about the health and environmental impacts of siting a\nconfined disposal facility adjacent to the Red Hook ball fields.\n3) Land Use and Development\nMany various properties abut the canal; the majority are industrial, commercial and\nmanufacturing. However, several lots along the canal have been re-classified as residential\nand further development along the canal and adjoining areas is expected.\n There was concern that the length of time it would take to remediate the canal would\nhave a negative impact on development along the canal.\n Residents were concerned about the impact of the upland development on any remedy\nEPA implements at the Canal.\n Concerns were expressed that lenders might become reluctant to provide funding for\npurchases or renovations of properties near the canal due to remediation efforts.\n Placing the Gowanus Canal on the superfund list would have a negative impact on\nproperty values.\n Concerns were expressed that cleanup of the canal should take place before\ndevelopment should move forward.\n Concerns were expressed that cleaning the canal would result in increased residential\ndevelopment along the canal.\n There are fears that cleaning the canal would result in displacing industrial/commercial\nbusinesses from Gowanus and relocating them in Red Hook.\n Concerns were expressed about how development along the canal could impact the\nimplementation of the cleanup plan.\n14\n Concerns were expressed that constructing a CDF or dewatering facility at the\nGowanus Bay Terminal site could have a negative impact on the community’s ability\nto implement flood mitigation.\n4) Archeological Preservation\nThe New York State Historic Preservation Office found the Gowanus Canal Historic District\neligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\n Concerns were expressed about the impact of remediation of the canal on existing\narcheological artifacts in the canal, including the original bulkheads and any\npotentially submerged cultural resources.\n Dredging the canal may uncover important artifacts, (possibly the lost Marylanders\nburial site); EPA needs to preserve these cultural resources.\n5) Population Growth\nThe neighborhoods of Gowanus, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Red Hook and Carroll Gardens are\nseeing an increase in population. Several multi-unit residential properties have been built in\nthese communities. Many individuals expressed concerns about the increased population\ndensity and its impact on the Gowanus Canal.\n Concerns were expressed with regard to the population increase and its impact on the\ncanal cleanup with respect to increased sewer discharge volume.\n With an increase of residential properties along the canal, EPA needs to consider the\nimpact of the implementation of the remedy on the individuals living in close\nproximity to the site.\n6) Technical Information\nEPA is responsible for communicating complex technical information to a wide audience.\nIndividuals expressed their position on how they would like the information to be shared.\n Complex technical principles should be (as much as possible) expressed in simple\nterms\n Photographs, graphic representations and visual aids should be used in technical\npresentations.\n EPA should consider conducting technical workshops to explain complex site related\nprinciples in an informal setting.\n7) Employment\n EPA should work toward providing employment opportunities for residents during the\nconstruction of and operation of the remedy\n8) Environmental Justice\n EPA’s outreach efforts should also target Communities with EJ concerns in public\n15\nhousing\n Outreach material should be provided in other languages (Spanish, Mandarin,\nRussian)\n EPA should ensure equal opportunity and access to site related information\n16\nSection 5: Community Involvement Action Plan\nThis section describes the specific activities and resources that EPA will use to help the\ncommunity be actively involved in the cleanup process. Whenever EPA begins work on a\nsite, it identifies a point of contact for community questions, issues or concerns. The two\nprimary points of contact for the Gowanus Canal are:\nChristos Tsiamis\nRemedial Project Manager\nU.S. EPA, Region 2\n290 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10007-1866\n212-637-4257\ntsiamis.christos@epa.gov\nNatalie Loney\nCommunity Involvement Coordinator\nUS EPA Region 2\n290 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10007-1866\n212 637-3639 or 800 346-5009\nloney.natalie@epa.gov\nIn addition to providing an EPA representative to answer questions, EPA uses other tools and\ntechniques to support the community’s involvement in EPA’s work.\n1. Fact Sheets, handouts and flyers\nFact sheets are one of EPA’s principal methods of providing site-related information to the\ncommunity. They are short (2-4 pages) documents, written in non-technical language that can\nbe e-mailed directly to the site’s mailing list, posted on the Gowanus webpage, mailed\ndirectly to residents or provided at meetings. They often summarize larger, technical\ndocuments. They include EPA contact information and refer people to the site related\nwebpage or site repository for more technical information. EPA will create fact sheets as\nevents dictate or in response to community requests for specific kinds of information.\nFlyers are 1-page notices that are generally used to announce meetings. EPA e-mails and/or\nmails flyers to the Gowanus e-mail list, posts them to the webpage, and also places them as\ndisplay ads in local papers\n17\n2. Community Meetings\nEPA holds public meetings at various milestones and at the request of the community. The\npublic information meetings are organized to convey Site information via presentations and\ndiscussions, and to answer questions from community members. Each meeting will be\nstructured to fit its purpose by using different formats (e.g. town hall meetings, open houses,\ninformal roundtables, PowerPoint presentations, etc.).\n3. Web Site\nEPA has created a website specifically for this Site. The website includes electronic copies of\nEPA’s investigation documents and will be one location for viewing the proposed cleanup\nplans as they are developed. EPA will update the webpage on a regular basis. The website for\nthe Gowanus Canal is located at:\nhttp://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/gowanus/\n4. Information Repository and Administrative Record\nEPA maintains a local public site file, which is called the “Information Repository.”\nThe Information Repository contains hardcopies of major site documents, fact sheets\nand other relevant items. Electronic copies on compact disk are also available at the\nrepository. EPA has established two information repositories for the Gowanus Canal\nSuperfund site. They are located at:\nCarroll Gardens Library Red Hook Library\n396 Clinton Street 7 Wolcott St. at Dwight St.\nBrooklyn, NY 11231 Brooklyn, NY 11231\nWhen EPA is ready to formally propose a cleanup action, it collects every document\nthat was used to develop and analyze the proposed action. This collection of technical\ndocuments is called the Administrative Record, and it is placed in both information\nrepositories.\n5. Mailing List\nEPA maintains a mailing list for distribution of fact sheets and meeting notices. To be\nadded or deleted from the mailing list, contact Natalie Loney, Community Involvement\nCoordinator, loney.natalie@epa.gov or call 212-637-3639.\n6. E-mail Group\nEPA maintains an e-mail list for electronic distribution of fact sheets, meeting notes, and\nperiodic site updates. To be added or deleted from the mailing list, contact Natalie Loney (see\nabove).\n18\n7. Proposed Plan\nWhen EPA is ready to formally propose a cleanup plan, it creates a special document called a\nProposed Plan. The Proposed Plan summarizes the contamination that has been found,\ncompares the various ways that the contamination can be cleaned up, and identifies one\npreferred alternative that EPA thinks balances all considerations. This is the most important\ntime for community input.\nEPA distributes the Proposed Plan to its mailing list, holds a minimum 30-day public\ncomment period and conducts a public meeting where the Proposed Plan is discussed and\npublic comments are taken.\n8. Responsiveness Summary for the Proposed Plan Comment Period\nWhen EPA makes a final decision about which cleanup methods it will use, it creates a\ndocument that explains how it has addressed the public comments that were received during\nthe comment period. This document is called a Responsiveness Summary, and it is a part of\nEPA’s decision document called the Record of Decision.\n9. Comment Periods\nEPA holds public comment period for certain documents. Sometimes the comment periods\nare less formal and not required, but nonetheless EPA wants to get the community’s\nthoughts. These comments periods may be announced in several ways, including a notice in a\nfact sheet, an announcement at a public meeting or through the email list.\n10. Public Notices\nFor those who are not on the site’s mailing list, EPA will announce community meetings and\nformal comment periods in a display advertisement in the main section of The Brooklyn\nPaper, Courier Life and the Red Hook Star Revue.\n11. Press Releases/Media contacts\nEPA will provide press releases and develop media contacts with the following newspapers:\nThe Brooklyn Eagle, New York Times, Daily News, New York Post, Courier Post and the\nRed Hook Star Revue.\n12. Technical Documents\nMost of the community residents had environmental and health concerns. They wanted a\nclear picture of the contamination at the site and how EPA planned to address those areas\nthrough some cleanup effort. The answers to those many of those questions will be in the\ntechnical documents that EPA will produce as part of its investigation and cleanup process.\nThe major documents will include a summary suitable for a general audience. EPA will also\nmail out a summary of some documents as a fact sheet. Below is a listing and short\n19\ndescription of those documents that will be developed over the course of the Superfund\ncleanup process.\n• Remedial Investigation Report (RI): The overall purpose of the RI is to identify the nature\nand extent of contaminants, migration pathways of the contaminants, and potential\nthreats to human and ecological receptors in the study area. The remedial investigation\nis usually done with the feasibility study. Together they are often referred to as the\n“RI/FS.”\n• Cultural Resources and Historic Building Survey: A report that includes archival research,\nan historic building survey, and an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of the\nSuperfund Site. The purpose of this report is to provide an inventory and assessment of\ncultural resources that might be affected by the Superfund cleanup.\n• Biological Evaluation: This report contains an ecological habitat survey of the Site and a\nbenthic invertebrate survey of the Gowanus Canal.\n• Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA): This document provides a qualitative and\nquantitative evaluation of the current and potential risks posed to human health by the\npresence of Site contaminants. Risk assessments evaluate both the carcinogenic risks\nand non-carcinogenic risks to human health from Site contaminants.\n• Feasibility Study (FS): A report that identifies cleanup objectives and alternatives to meet\nthose objectives, and evaluates each alternative using the first seven of EPA’s nine\ncriteria which are: protection of human health and environment; compliance with\napplicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs); long-term effectiveness\nand permanence; reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume through treatment; short-\nterm effectiveness; implementability; cost; state acceptance; and community\nacceptance. The evaluation of State and community acceptance criteria is completed\nafter the receipt of public comments during the 30-day comment period for the\nProposed Plan.\n• Record of Decision: A public document that explains which cleanup methods, actions,\ntools and/or techniques will be used at the Site, including the residual contamination\nlevels (if any) and any restrictions on future land use (where waste is left in place).\n• Remedial Design: The development of engineering drawings and specifications for a site\ncleanup. This phase follows the remedial investigation/feasibility study. A fact sheet\nmay be distributed when the design work is at 70% complete.\n15. Technical Assistance Grant (TAG)\nA TAG is a federal grant awarded to an incorporated nonprofit organization of community\nmembers affected by the site. It is used to fund an environmental professional to provide an\n20\nindependent technical review of cleanup documents. An initial grant up to $50,000 is\navailable to help the community understand technical information about their site.\n16. Community Advisory Group (CAG)\nA CAG is a self-forming, self-governing stakeholder group that meets periodically, but\nregularly, to learn about EPA’s cleanup process, discusses their issues and concerns, and\nprovides feedback to EPA. EPA is able to provide support to the CAG by attending the\nmeetings, and providing technical support. (For more information on CAG’s go to:\nwww.epa.gov/superfund/community/cag/index.htm)\nA CAG has been formed at the Gowanus Canal superfund site. The Gowanus CAG has\nestablished a webpage for Gowanus related information at:\nwww.gowanuscag.org\nIn addition, CAG meeting minutes can be accessed at:\nwww.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/gowanus/cag.html\n17. Social Media\nIn addition to more traditional methods of disseminating information EPA is also using social\nmedia to share site related information with the public. As such EPA created a Gowanus\nCanal Group Facebook page:\nwww.facebook.com/groups/195975002802/\nThe group page serves as a way for EPA to share information with the public and for the\npublic to raise and discuss issues related to the Gowanus Canal. In addition, the agency\nutilizes Twitter to announce public meetings and major milestones regarding the Gowanus\nCanal.\n21\nAppendix A\nEPA Regional Contacts\nChristos Tsiamis\nRemedial Project Manager\nU.S. EPA, Region 2\nTel: 212-637-4257\ntsiamis.christos@epa.gov\nNatalie Loney\nCommunity Involvement Coordinator\nUS EPA Region 2\n290 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10007-1866\nTel: 212 637-3639 or 800 346-5009\nloney.natalie@epa.gov\nGeorge H.

(GEI) conducted an\necotoxicological investigation to determine whether and what water and/or sediment\ncontaminants were affecting the aquatic biological community observed in the Gowanus\nCanal. To perform this task we analyzed and interpreted the relationship between biotic and\nabiotic variables from current GEI sampling and previous studies conducted on the Gowanus\nCanal. Our ecotoxicological findings were the following:\n1. Gowanus Canal sediment and water quality appears to be adversely impacted by\nmultiple chemical and physical stressors largely unrelated to contaminants\nassociated with former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations.\n2. Canal sediments were toxic to sediment dwelling organisms in controlled\nlaboratory exposures with sewage-related contaminants, including ammonia being\nthe drivers of the toxicity.\n3. Current canal benthic invertebrate communities are inherently impoverished due\nto the chemical stressors related to combined sewer outfall (CSO) discharges and\nother sources. As a result, the benthic communities consist of organisms tolerant\nto organic pollution associated with sewage, the distribution of which seems to be\ndriven by physical habitat variability.\n1.1 Gowanus Canal – A Class SD Waterbody\nThe State of New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) has\nestablished a number of classes of waters (New York State Water Quality Regulations\nSurface Water and Groundwater Classifications and Standards New York State Codes, Rules\nand Regulations [NYCRR) Title 6 Chapter X Parts 700-7006 Department of Environmental\nConservation). The general classes relevant to waters like Gowanus Canal are listed below:\n1. Class I saline surface waters- The best usages of Class I waters are secondary\ncontact recreation and fishing. These waters shall be suitable for fish\npropagation and survival (6 NYCRR §701.13).\n2. Class SA saline surface waters - The best usages of Class SA waters are\nshellfishing for market purposes, primary and secondary contact recreation\nand fishing. These waters shall be suitable for fish propagation and survival\n(6 NYCRR §701.10).\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 1 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n3. Class SB saline surface waters - The best usages of Class SB waters are\nprimary and secondary contact recreation and fishing. These waters shall be\nsuitable for fish propagation and survival (6 NYCRR §701.11).\n4. Class SC saline surface waters - The best usage of Class SC waters is fishing.\nThese waters shall be suitable for fish propagation and survival. The water\nquality shall be suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation,\nalthough other factors may limit the use for these purposes (6 NYCRR\n§701.12).\n5. Class SD saline surface waters - The best usage of Class SD waters is fishing.\nThese waters shall be suitable for fish survival. This classification may be\ngiven to those waters that, because of natural or man-made conditions, cannot\nmeet the requirements for primary and secondary contact recreation and fish\npropagation (6 NYCRR §701.14).\nGowanus Canal is classified as Class SD. As such, it is not suitable for fish propagation or\ncontact recreation. This classification acknowledges the historic contamination of the canal.\n1.2 Ecotoxicology Study Approach\nThis evaluation was conducted in a number of steps (see diagram below). First, we evaluated\nthe potential aquatic community impacts by comparing sediment and water quality data\ncollected by GEI to sediment ecological screening benchmarks and Class SD water quality\nstandards or guidance values. Next, potential sediment contamination sources, such as\npermitted and unpermitted outfalls, were evaluated. Sediment toxicity testing data from U.S.\nArmy Corp of Engineers (USACE, 2003) studies were used to validate predicted chemical\nstressor impacts and identify relationships with specific contaminants that might influence\nsediment toxicity. Finally, biological data collected by the USACE was analyzed with\nrespect local reference conditions, sediment contamination, and physical habitat data.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 2 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nDiagram of Conceptual Approach Used to Evaluate Gowanus Canal\nWhat are the “potential”\necological impacts?\nAre the sediments really toxic?\nSediment Benchmarks:\n% Exceedance Are there impacts to\nToxicity Quotients Sediment benthic organisms in\nToxicity\nthe canal?\nTesting\nPotential Sources\nBenthic Invertebrate\nWater Quality Criteria: Community\n% Exceedance Analysis\nToxicity Quotients\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 3 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n2.0 General Methods\nA total of eight unique datasets were evaluated for this ecotoxicological investigation of the\nGowanus Canal, as follows.\n• 2006 GEI Sediment data\n• 2006 GEI Water Quality Data\n• 2006 GEI Outfall Water Quality Data\n• 2005 USACE Sediment Data\n• 2005 USACE Sediment Toxicity Data\n• 2003 USACE Ponar Data\n• 2004 Lawler Hester-Dendy (H-D) Data\n• 2003/2004 USACE Ichthyoplancton, Fish, and Crab Data\nThese datasets were used in all statistical analyses and to create tables and figures. An\nanalyte matrix, listing all potential contaminants that were investigated with respect to each\ndata source, can be found in Appendix A. Below is a brief description of how each dataset\nwas prepared for report analyses. Detailed descriptions of database preparation and the\nresulting data can be found in Appendix A (Figure A-1).\n2.1 2006 Sediment Data\nThe 2006 sediment data were collected by GEI along transects established in the Gowanus\nCanal (Keyspan, 2005). These data were collected at all sediment depths. Because we are\ninterested in ecological effects of sediment exposure, only surficial sediments (0-3 ft) were\nanalyzed. Benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms would not be expected to inhabit deeper\nsediments. The 0 to 3 ft sediment sampling depth interval is consistent with reference\nburrowing depths for deep burrowing organisms (Kropp and Diaz, 1995).\nNon-detect values were carefully examined and unreasonably high non-detect values were\ndeleted from further analyses. After screening the non-detect values, all remaining\ncontaminant values from all samples were condensed into single values for each respective\ntransect Detailed methods for developing the databases used for analysis, as well as the\nresulting screened and organized 2006 sediment data, can be found in Appendix A.\n2.2 2006 Water Quality Data\nThe 2006 water quality data were collected by GEI along the same transects established in\nthe 2006 sediment dataset. These data were collected at two depths, surface and at the\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 4 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nsediment water column interface. The 2006 water quality datasets are presented in\nAppendix A.\n2.3 2005 Sediment Data\nThe 2005 sediment data were collected on behalf of the USACE by DMA, Inc (2006). Site\nlocations ranged from the upstream portion of the Gowanus Canal to below the Carrol\nGardens/Public Place MGP site (but above the Metropolitan former MGP site). Samples\nwere analyzed for metals, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), polychlorinated\nbiphenyl’s (PCBs), pesticides, grain size, and total organic carbon (TOC) (See contaminant\nmatrix in Appendix A).\nThese sediment data were then organized into transects and matched to the nearest GEI\ntransect. Non-detect values were screened using the same method as the GEI sediment data.\nThese sediment datasets are presented in Appendix A.\nIn addition, we investigated, but did not use, analytical sediment data collected by the\nUSACE in 2003. Once categorized into depth categories, we found that only two samples\nwere collected from surficial sediments and was too limited to be used in our investigations.\n2.4 Outfall Water Quality Data\nOutfall water quality (WQ) data were collected by GEI during a dry weather period between\nAugust 2 and 11 2006. Only samples from 11 actively flowing outfalls discharging into the\ncanal above the waterline (including one CSO) were used in our analysis. Each sample was\nmatched to the nearest GEI transect.\n2.5 Sediment Toxicity Tests\nSediment toxicity tests were conducted on behalf of the USACE by AquaSurvey, Inc. (2005),\nas presented in the DMA (2006) report, for sediments collected in September 2005. Testing\nwas conducted using the amphipod Ampelisca abdita in a 10 day exposure whole sediment\nbioassay. Toxicity test results, water quality conditions, and notes are summarized in the\ntoxicity test dataset found in Appendix A.\n2.6 Biological Data\nThree separate biological datasets were available for our investigations into Gowanus Canal\necology. These datasets included data from benthic invertebrate communities, water column\n‘epibenthic’ invertebrate communities, and limited data from fish trawls and fish/crab trap\nsampling efforts. A brief summary of each of the four datasets are provided below.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 5 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nBenthic invertebrates were sampled in April 2003 using a petite Ponar benthic sampler by\nUSACE (2003) at 28 stations with two replicates per site. Station locations ranged though\nthe entire length of the canal from the flushing tunnel to Gowanus Bay. Latitude/longitude\ncoordinates used to identify site locations were matched to 15 GEI transects. Limited water\nquality parameters were recorded by the USACE at each sample location. These data on the\nbiological community of the canal form the primary basis of our ecotoxicological analysis.\nThe second dataset was created from H-D epibenthic community sampling. Epibenthic\ncommunity invertebrates were sampled by Lawler, Matusky, and Skelly Engineers, LLP, for\nthe USACE at five locations in the Gowanus Canal and Bay using H-D style samplers\n(Lawler et al. 2004). These data were limited and did not lend themselves to detailed\ncomparisons to sediment or water quality and were not evaluated further.\nThe third dataset was a combination of the ichthyoplankton, adult fish, and crab trap data\ncollected on behalf of the USACE in 2003 through 2004 using trap nets and trawl nets\n(Lawler et al. 2004). Since these data were collected at fewer locations and could not be\neasily matched to the GEI transects or abiotic datasets, only qualitative summary results are\npresented.\n2.7 Data Quality Assurance and Quality Control\nDue to the quantity of data and the large number of calculations which had to be performed\nfor data analysis, a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocol was established.\nAll efforts were made to be as easily understandable as possible when creating all of the\nanalyses datasets and details are provided in Appendix A.\n2.8 Statistical Analyses\nMultiple parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed in our\necotoxicological evaluation of the Gowanus Canal. Statistical tests are explained in greater\ndetail when presented in the report and in Appendix A. As part of every parametric\nstatistical analysis, the assumptions of equal variance and normality were tested and data was\ntransformed, when appropriate. For all analyses, significance was set with an alpha level of\n0.05 (i.e., only a 5 percent chance of a statistical difference occurring by chance). All\nstatistical data analyses were conducted using NCSS 2004, SPSS 15.0, and CANOCO for\nWindows 4.5 software packages.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 6 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n3.0 Evaluation of Potential Ecotoxicological\nImpacts\n3.1 Sediment Quality\nFor many contaminants, low and median toxic effect estimates derived from field studies\nacross the nation were used as surrogate sediment screening benchmarks. Effects range\nestimates were established to indicate levels of sediment contamination that can be tolerated\nby the majority of benthic organisms (Long et al. 1995) for contaminants in marine and\nestuarine sediments, as presented in Tables 3 and 4 of the New York State Department\nEnvironmental of Conservation (NYSDEC) Technical Guidance Document (NYSDEC,\n1999). If the concentration is greater than the Effects Range-Median (ERM), the sediment is\n“contaminated” and significant harm to benthic aquatic life is anticipated (NYSDEC, 1999).\nA number of contaminants do not have ERM values for evaluation of potential toxicity. The\nNYSDEC has developed a contaminated-sediment screening technical guidance document\n(NYSDEC, 1999) to develop sediment criteria based on the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) equilibrium partitioning (EP) model. The role of EP-based sediment criteria\nis for screening potentially contaminated sediments and providing an initial assessment of\npossible adverse impacts to aquatic biota from those sediments.\nEP-based sediment criteria are tied to water quality standards and guidance values.\nTherefore, within the framework of New York State water quality regulations, sediment\ncriteria were derived according to the primary levels of protection for available Class SD\nwater quality standards or guidance values presented in Division of Water TOGS 1.1.1\n(1998). Because these criteria are scaled to sediment TOC, EP-based criteria can be thought\nof as site-specific sediment criteria (SSSC). SSSC were derived using available Class SD\nwater quality standards or guidance values.\nThe affinity of non-polar organic compounds to organic carbon ultimately defines\nbioavailability and exposure to sediment dwelling organisms. Other compounds such as\nmetals exhibit many properties in water that largely depend on the form or species in which\nthe metal occurs. The toxicity and bioavailability of metals in water and sediment are highly\ninfluenced by environmental conditions such as pH, alkalinity, REDOX potential, and\navailability of complexing ions or ligands. Additionally, the complexity of metals behavior\nin sediments makes accurately predicting levels at which toxic effects will occur difficult.\nThese caveats need to be kept in mind when evaluating the significance of an exceedance of\nthese thresholds.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 7 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nIn our screening analysis of Gowanus Canal sediments, SSSC or ERM guidance values for\nmarine and estuarine sediments were used as toxicity benchmarks. When both SSSC and an\nERM were available, the ERM benchmark was given priority over the water quality criteria\nderived sediment benchmark since it is derived from measured sediment-biology\nrelationships. The ERM was chosen over the Effects Range-Low (ERL) as the benchmark\ncriteria because this would be the most appropriate standard for a Class SD waterbody based\non protection categories established by the state for Class SD waters (i.e. fish survival).\nThe potential for ecological impacts from sediment contamination were evaluated two ways.\nThe first was to determine how often the sediment thresholds (ERM or SSSC) were exceeded\n(i.e., the frequency, or percent of values over the threshold). The second approach was based\non the magnitude of sediment benchmark exceedances, based on the ratio of the measured\nvalues to the threshold, also called a “Toxicity Quotient” or TQ. TQs > 1 would be\npredictive of toxicity (i.e., measured concentrations are greater than the threshold). Because\naquatic biota are only expected to be exposed to surficial sediments, only samples collected\nwithin the top 3 feet of sediment cores were evaluated in our analysis.\n3.1.1 Sediment Benchmark Exceedances\nTwenty-six ERM values were available to develop 26 ERM-based TQs. Fourteen Class SD\nWQ standards, seven guidance values, and three default sediment screening values were\navailable to develop a total of 24 SSSC-based TQs for this analysis. In total, 50 specific\ncontaminants or contaminant class totals (i.e., total PCBs) were available for development of\npercent exceedance and TQs, with respect to transect results.\n3.1.1.1 Exceedance Analyses\nOf the 50 contaminants for which a criteria benchmark was available, only eight were found\nat levels below respective benchmarks or detection limits. In contrast, 18 contaminants were\nabove the benchmarks in 100 percent of the measured transect values. Most of these 18\ncontaminants were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, and pesticides. All\ntransects exceeded at least 20 sediment toxicity benchmarks. Figure 1 presents the transect-\nspecific benchmark exceedance rates with all contaminants combined. No clear-cut patterns\nof exceedances were noted among transects and results indicated that sediments in all areas\nof the Gowanus Canal are potentially toxic to aquatic life.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 8 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n100\nFull Dataset (n=50)\nW/Out PAHs (n=36)\n90\ne\nc 80\nn\na\nd\n70\ne\ne\nc\nx 60\nE\n% 50\nk\na r 40\nm\nh 30\nc\nn\ne 20\nB\n10\n0\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA4th6th7th11th\nTransect\nFigure 1: Cumulative sediment criteria benchmark exceedance rates for each transect.\nExceedance rates derived using the full dataset contained 50 contaminants.\nExceedance rates derived using the full dataset minus polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants contained 36 contaminants.\nTo explain the influence of PAHs in exceedance rates, we removed all PAHs and re-analyzed\nthe data (Figure 1). Fourteen PAHs were removed allowing an examination of exceedance\nrates for the remaining 36 contaminants (including SVOCs, volatile organic compounds\n[VOCs], PCBs, pesticides, and metals). Even after removing PAHs, the minimum number of\nexceedances was 30 percent, with most transects having 50 percent or greater frequency of\nexceedances. From this figure it is clear that the spatial patterns of exceedances are similar\nbetween the two datasets; with a substantial percentage of exceedances for each transect even\nwith PAHs removed.\n3.1.1.2 Toxicity Quotient Analyses\nTo investigate the magnitude of sediment benchmark exceedances, we derived cumulative\nTQs for each contaminant category and transect (Figure 2). From this analysis it can be seen\nthat cumulative PAH, PCB, pesticide, and metal TQs are greater than one (zero on the log10\nscale) for each transect in the canal. Cumulative VOC TQs, including the sum of benzene,\ntoluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX), were greater than one in just over a third of all of\nthe transects. The greatest cumulative TQs were derived for PAHs; although this only\naccounts for roughly half the total toxicity at any one transect. These results indicate that\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 9 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nsediment quality is greatly impacted by multiple contaminant stressors. Additionally, the\ncumulative impact of all non-PAH contaminants is at least similar to PAH impacts. In\nsummary, Gowanus Canal sediments are greatly impacted by multiple chemical stressors.\nWhen analyte results were compared to sediment screening benchmarks, high exceedance\nrates and TQs were derived for each transect.\n7\ns Other\nQ\nPAH\nT\n6\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nl 5\nu\nm\nu\nC 4\nd\ne\nm\nr 3\no\nf\ns\nn\na 2\nr\nT\n0\n1 1\ng\no\nL\n0\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA 4th 6th 7th11th\nTransect\nFigure 2: Cumulative log transformed sediment benchmark Toxicity Quotients (TQs) for\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other contaminants, primarily\npolychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, metals, and volatile organic compounds,\nwhich included benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX).\n3.2 Evaluation of potential sediment contamination sources\nAfter establishing the frequency and magnitude of benchmark exceedances, we identified\nthat active outfalls were a potential source of surficial sediment contamination within the\ncanal. To identify outfall sources, active CSOs and outfalls discharging unknown effluents\nwere sampled by GEI. Collected effluent samples were analyzed for similar contaminants as\nperformed in sediment analyses. When an analyte was measured in the outfall effluent it was\nmatched to the analyte-transect matched sediment value. These pairs (outfall/sediment\nresults) were separated into contaminant classes and regressed (Figure 3).\nWhen each contaminant class-paired effluent/sediment data were regressed, the relationship\nbetween outfall and sediment analytes identified a statistically significant positive\nrelationship between the outfall data and paired sediment quality for metals (slope = 0.71)\nand combined pesticides, PCBs, and VOCs (slope = 0.68). The BTEX regression resulted in\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 10 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\na slightly positive slope (slope = 0.06) that was not statistically significant (Table 1). No\nrelationship was noted between PAH concentrations in outfall effluents and sediments within\nthe same transect (slope < 0.001). These results indicate that outfalls are a potential source of\nsediment contamination in terms of metals, pesticides, PCBs, VOCs, and to a lesser extent\nBTEX.\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-5 -3 -1 1 3 5 7 9 11 13\nLn (Effluent Concentration [ug/L])\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 11 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n)]gk/gm[\nnoitartnecnoC\ntnemideS(\nnL\nBTEX\nPAH\nMetals\nPest,PCBs,VOCs\nFigure 3: Scatter plot of paired effluent/sediment contaminant results.

Figure 4 shows the cumulative log transformed\noutfall effluent specific TQs for PAHs, PCBs, pesticides, and metals.\nAnalysis of respective TQs showed that active outfalls throughout the Gowanus Canal are\ndischarging potentially significantly toxic concentrations of several contaminants. Overall,\nthese outfalls represent unknown sources. It is important to note that TQs derived for VOCs,\nwhich included BTEX, were less than one, indicating that during outfall sampling these\ncontaminants were not being discharged at potentially toxic levels.\nTable 1: Paired effluent/sediment data summary and regression results.

Examination\nof effluent from this outfall indicated that only three contaminants were identified and\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 12 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nmeasured at concentrations greater than the non-detection limits. These contaminants\nincluded barium, manganese, and fecal coliform; none of which have a toxicity benchmark\nneeded to derive respective TQs. The large PAH cumulative TQ identified in outfall sample\nnumber 100 (GC-OF-100) was almost entirely due to benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). The outfall,\nGC-OF-100, is not permitted under NYDES SPDES or EPA NPDES. The exact source of\nthat outfall effluent is uncertain. Active discharge was observed. The discharge had\nmoderate petroleum-like odor and sheen was observed in the effluent sample (GEI, field\nobservations). BAP was also found in surface water samples near this outfall (see below).\nInterestingly, the transect corresponding to this outfall (Transect H) had the greatest BAP\nwater column analyte results at concentrations that were roughly five fold that of the next\ngreatest measurement.\n3.3 Water Quality\nTo investigate potential chemical stressors in the canal, water column analyte data were\nevaluated using a toxicity benchmark or criteria screen. Class SD water quality standards or\nguidance values served as toxicity benchmarks and were used to predict potential ecological\nharm when compared to measured contaminant values. New York State defines water\nquality standards with respect to classification of surface waters. Gowanus Canal is\nclassified as Class SD saline surface water; therefore, canal waters should be suitable for fish\nsurvival or “no acute toxicity.” It is important to note that Class SD waters are not intended\nto protect for more sensitive chronic toxicity endpoints such as fish propagation, although a\nfew Class SD standards are set according to more sensitive endpoints. For water quality\nscreening purposes, 15 Class SD standards, 10 guidance values, and four narrative standards\nwere compared to transect condensed measured water column analyte concentrations. From\nthese comparisons the frequency and magnitude, measured as TQs, of exceedances were\ndeveloped as discussed above.\nWe compared transect condensed water quality results to available standards or guidance\nvalues to develop transect specific TQs for each contaminant (Table 2). The NYSDEC also\nprovides narrative standards for Class SD waters outlined in 6 NYCRR §703.2 Narrative\nWater Quality Standards. Additionally, water quality standards for dissolved oxygen (D.O.),\nodor, color and floatables, are provided in 6 NYCRR §703.3. The appropriate narrative\nstandard for oil and floating substances states that “No residue attributable to sewage,\nindustrial wastes or other wastes, nor visible oil film nor globules of grease.” The Class SD\nstandards for D.O. “Shall not be less than 3.0 milligrams per liter (mg/L) at any time.”\nObservational accounts of sampling locations and conditions were used to screen narrative\nwater quality standards. The averaged transect specific D.O. results were used to determine\nrespective standard adherence. Because of the narrative nature of these additional water\nquality standards, TQs could only be derived for D.O. Exceedance rates were developed for\neach narrative standard.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 13 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nTable 2: Class SD standards, guidance values, and narrative standards used to derive\npercent exceedance and Toxicity Quotients.\nClass SD\nClass SD WQ\nWQ Narrative Class\nContaminant Guidance Comments\nStandards SD WQ Standards\nValues (µg/L)\n(µg/L)\nGuidance value used over\nBenzene 10 a 670 b standard due preference\nfor fish survival endpoint\nGuidance value used over\nToluene 6000 a 430 b standard due preference\nfor fish survival endpoint\nEthylbenzene 41 b\nXylene 170 b\nAcenaphthene 60 b\nFluorene 23 b\n2-Methylnaphthalene 38 b\nNaphthalene 140 b\nPhenanthrene 14 b\nBenzo[a]pyrene 0.0006 a\nAldrin 0.001 a\nAlpha-\nBenzenehexachloride 0.002 a\n(BHC)\nBeta-BHC 0.007 a\nDelta – BHC 0.008 a\nEpsilon – BHC 0.008 a\nGamma-BHC 0.008 a\nAlpha-Chlordane 0.00002 a\nTrans-Chlordane 0.00002 a\nDDT, DDE, DDD (sum) 0.000011 e\n0.0000006\nDieldrin\na\nEndosulfan 0.034 b\nEndrin 0.002 a\nHeptachlor 0.0002 a\nHeptachlor epoxide 0.0003 a\nToxaphene 0.07 b\nPCBs total 0.00012 e\nCopper 7.9 b\nLead 204 b\nMercury 0.0026 d\nNickel 74 b\nZinc 95 b\nShall not be less than\nDissolved Oxygen (D.O.)\n3.0 mg/L at any time.\nNone in amounts that\nwill adversely affect the\ntaste, color or odor\nOdor\nthereof, or impair the\nwaters for their best\nusages.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 14 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nClass SD\nClass SD WQ\nWQ Narrative Class\nContaminant Guidance Comments\nStandards SD WQ Standards\nValues (µg/L)\n(µg/L)\nNone in amounts that\nwill adversely affect the\ntaste, color or odor\nClarity\nthereof, or impair the\nwaters for their best\nusages.\nNo residue attributable\nto sewage, industrial\nFloatables wastes or other wastes,\nnor visible oil film nor\nglobules of grease\na = Human consumption of fish (saline waters)\nb = Fish survival (saline waters)\nc = Fish propagation (saline waters)\nd = Aesthetic (saline waters)\ne = Wildlife protection (saline waters)\nWater quality standards for the state’s waters are compiled in the Division of Water\nTechnical and Operational Guidance Series 1.1.1 (Division of Water, 1998). This document\nprovides ambient water quality standards and guidance values for toxic and non-conventional\npollutants derived under the authority of Article 17 of the Environmental Conservation Law\nand 6 NYCRR Parts 700-706, Water Quality Regulations. A standard value is a numeric\nconcentration value that has been promulgated and placed into regulation. A guidance value\nmay be used where a standard for a substance or a group of substances has not been\nestablished. Standards and guidance values are the maximum allowable concentration for a\ndefined water classification.\n3.3.1 Water Quality Exceedances\nSeventeen Class SD water quality standards, 10 guidance values, and four narrative standards\nwere available for analytical results comparisons (Appendix A). Surface water samples from\nnear the surface and bottom of the water column were analyzed separately and combined\nwhen comparing water quality standards. Due to laboratory methods, analytical detection\nlimits were often greater than Class SD water quality standards, but when a concentration\nabove the detection limit was obtained, a percent exceedance or TQ value was derived. We\ncompared the Class SD water quality standards and guidance values to transect specific\nresults and used a pass/fail logical test to screen exceedance rates between transects and\ncontaminants or narrative standards. The Class SD water quality standards and guidance\nvalues were used to derive TQs for each transect. The TQs were derived as the ratio of each\nmeasured value over each transect’s specific criteria. These TQs were combined.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 15 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n3.3.1.1 Exceedance Analyses\nOf the 25 contaminants for which a standard or guidance value was available, 11\ncontaminants were found at levels below respective criteria benchmarks or detection limits.\nIn 11 other contaminants, 100 percent of measured values were found above respective\ncriteria benchmarks - most of these were pesticides. The number of numeric criteria\nexceedances ranged from 53 percent to zero exceedances (Figure 5).\n60\n* = same with or without PAHs\nFull Dataset (n=29)\nW/Out PAHs (n=23)\n50\ne\nc\nn\na\nd40\ne\ne\nc * * *\nx\nE\n% 30\na\nri *\ne\nri\nt20\nC\nQ * *\nW * *\n10\n0\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V BB W X Y Z AA4th6th7th\nTransect\nTransect\nFigure 5: Transect specific Class SD water quality (WQ) standard, guidance value, and\nnarrative standard exceedance rates for the full dataset and the full dataset without\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\nFour narrative standards were also assessed in conjunction with numeric criteria. There were\nno notable differences in D.O., odor, or floatables narrative standard exceedances between\nsurface and bottom collected samples. The D.O. Class SD criterion (3 mg/L) was not met in\n35 percent of the surface sampled transect results and 39 percent of bottom sampled results.\nD.O. measured in surface water samples from above sediment surface ranged 1.6 mg/L to\n12.4 mg/L and the median value was 3.3 mg/L, indicating surface sediments are also most\nlikely anoxic. Twenty percent of the surface collected samples exceeded the color narrative\nstandard “No increase that will cause a substantial visible contrast to natural conditions.”\nThe Class SD odor narrative standard “None in amounts that will adversely affect the taste,\ncolor or odor thereof, or impair the waters for their best usages” was exceeded in 6 percent\nand 13 percent of the surface and bottom transect results, respectively. The “No residue\nattributable to sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes, nor visible oil film nor globules of\ngrease” standard was exceeded in 81 percent of the surface and 68 percent of the bottom\ncollected samples. The majority of these exceedances were associated with spotty sheens\nand observed fecal matter within the Canal.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 16 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nWhen the surface and bottom water column results were condensed, the 6th and 7th Street\nturning basins had the greatest number of narrative standards exceedances (75 percent) and\nTransect L had zero narrative exceedances.\nTo investigate numeric and narrative exceedance rates with respect to PAHs, we analyzed\nanalyte results with and without PAHs. Figure 5 presents exceedance rates for the two\ndatasets. From this figure it can be seen that only 7 transects have a fewer exceedances\nwithout PAHs. Interestingly, 15 of the transects have a greater proportion of exceedances\nafter PAH results were removed. Eight transects have the same proportion of exceedances\nwith or without PAHs. The minimal difference between each dataset for most transects, and\nincreased rates in many others, indicates that PAHs are not appreciably contributing to the\nrespective total number of water quality exceedances in the canal.\n3.3.1.2 Toxicity Quotient Analyses\nTo investigate the magnitude of Class SD water quality standard or guidance value\nexceedances, we derived cumulative TQs for each contaminant category and transect\n(Figure 6). The PAH category represents cumulative TQs for each PAH contaminant, except\nbenzo[a]pyrene (BAP). BAP was removed from the water quality analysis due to it being\nmeasured at concentrations greater than the aqueous solubility and a low Class SD standard\nto protect human consumption of fish. This combination resulted in a biologically\ninsignificant inflated TQ that confused results comparisons.\nWith BAP removed, Transect H had the greatest cumulative TQ due to high pesticide and\nPAH TQs. Pesticide TQs were also elevated in Transects P, Q, 6th and 7th Street basins.\nPotential sources for these pesticides at these transects is uncertain. Cumulative metal TQs\nwere greater than 1 (zero on the Log10 scale) in 7 transects, with the greatest value observed\nin Transect G. When measured above the minimum detection limits, in Transects T, U, and\n7th St, total PCBs TQs were very high. Transects T and U are located immediately\ndownstream of the 9th street bridge. For 7th street basin, an active unpermitted discharge\nfound at outfall GC-OF-057 contained PCBs, Although BTEX compounds were measured at\neach transect, results were far below respective benchmarks; thus, TQs were less than one\nand are not presented.\nIn summary, BTEX compound results were substantially less than Class SD guidance values.\nEvaluation of all other water quality results with respect to water quality criteria were\ncomplicated by detection limits that were often greater than Class SD water quality standards\nor guidance values. However, when measured above the detection limits, BAP, total PCBs,\nchlordane, and heptachlor results were greater and chromium, nickel, and zinc results were\nless than screening criteria. D.O. was below the minimum criteria to protect fish survival in\nover 40 percent of the transects and aesthetic narrative standards were not met at most sites\ndue to oil surface sheens.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 17 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n6\ns\nQ Other\ne\nT 5 PAH\nv\nti\na\nul\n4\nm\nu\nC\nd\ne 3\nm\nr\no\nf\nn s 2\na\nr\nT\n0\n1 1\ng\no\nL\n0\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V BB W X Y Z AA 4th 6th 7th\nTransect\nFigure 6: Log10 transformed cumulative water column Toxicity Quotients (TQs).

The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) category\nrepresents cumulative TQs for each PAH contaminant, except benzo[a]pyrene (see\ntext).\nThis water quality analysis identified the frequency and magnitude of Class SD criteria\nexceedances with respect to condensed transect analytical results. These results indicate that\nmultiple contaminants are predicted to be contributing to the degraded water quality\ncondition of the Gowanus Canal, primarily as a result of non-PAH contaminants.\n3.4 Analysis Limitations\nIn general, data limitations fall into two categories, issues related to non-detect values and the\navailability (or lack thereof) of potential toxicity benchmarks Deleting unreasonably high\nnon-detect values from further analyses could introduce some selection bias. The direction\nof this selection bias would be towards lowering the potential magnitude of contamination,\nsince unreasonably high non-detection values were not used in working datasets. In sediment\nanalyses the physical matrix of each sample influences the respective analyte detection\nlimits; therefore, the magnitude of non-detect values can be variable even within a single\ncontaminant between samples. We felt that is was important to retain as much data as\npossible by carefully screening non-detection values when enough additional data was\navailable to screen the magnitude of respective analyte results. This methodology is\nconsistent with EPA data usability guidance (EPA, 1990; Smith, 1991). The main objective\nfor these data manipulations was to critically retain as much data as possible for use in\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 18 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\npotential impact analyses. Detailed methods for developing the databases used for analysis,\nas well as the resulting screened and organized datasets can be found in Appendix A.\nOf the 108 potential sediment contaminants, 31 contaminants had non-detection analyte\nresults that were manipulated. The degree of non-detect manipulation was not equal among\nthese 31 contaminants. The greatest number of non-detect manipulations occurred in BTEX,\n2-methylnaphthalene, and gamma-chlordane analyte datasets (see Appendix A 2006 -\nsediment datasets). Perhaps the most influential data manipulations were for two PAHs,\ndibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[k]fluoranthene. In these contaminants non-detection values\nin samples from Transects O, T, and V were deemed too high and subsequently deleted from\nthe working datasets. Implications of these deletions were most noticeable in our benchmark\nanalyses with dibenz[a,h]anthracene, where TQs for Transect O, T, and V could not be\nderived. Benzo[k]fluoranthene did not have a sediment benchmark; therefore, deletion\nresults only lowered total PAH estimates.\nOf the potential water quality contaminants, only 6 contaminants had non-detection analyte\nresults that were manipulated. As in the sediment dataset the greatest number of non-detect\nmanipulations occurred of BTEX analytes. The relatively small number of contaminants in\nwhich non-detection manipulations were performed was dependent on the fact that few\ncontaminants had actual measured results at most transects. Because we could not critically\ncompare the non-detection results to measured analyte concentrations, few contaminant non-\ndetects were manipulated. It is important to note that effluent water quality results were not\nmanipulated and data was used, as is, for all respective analyses.\nThe second data limitation issue involved the availability of potential toxicity benchmarks.\nSince our percent exceedance and TQ analyses depended on the availability of ERM or Class\nSD water quality standard/guidance values, our potential toxicity estimation scope of\ninference was limited. Of the 108 sediment contaminants that were analyzed, toxicity\nbenchmarks were only available for 50 contaminants. Even fewer water quality benchmarks\nwere available, because ERM benchmarks are not intended for use in water quality screens.\nEven though benchmarks were not available for all contaminants, exceedance rates and\nmagnitude of toxicity was potentially captured in respective total contaminant “class”\ncategories. For example, potentially toxic PAHs that had no sediment benchmarks were\npotentially characterized in the total PAH benchmark. This is the reason why total PAH and\nPCB benchmark analysis results were included with individual analyte benchmark results.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 19 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n4.0 Evaluation of Sediment Toxicity\nSince benchmark/analyte result comparisons only predict potential toxic effects in aquatic\nbiota, it was important to follow up our analyses with results from recently conducted\nsediment toxicity testing. The USACE conducted sediment toxicity tests using a sensitive\nbenthic invertebrate species exposed to canal sediments (AquaSurvey, Inc., 2005; DMA,\nInc., 2006).\nResults showed significant sediment toxicity to the test organisms after 10 day exposures\n(Table 3). Additional data provided in toxicity test results included pore water ammonia\nconcentrations for each sediment sample. Ammonia is potentially toxic to invertebrates.\nSediment test guidelines state that ammonia has to be lowered before test initiation and this\nwas done via static renewal of overlying water prior to 10 day exposures. The source of\nammonia in test sediments was likely due to the decay of nitrogenous organic matter from\nthe CSOs. Ammonia is a common suspect in failed sediment toxicity tests (Moore et al.\n1996). Although a positive relationship was found between both initial pore water and test\nammonia concentrations and percent mortality, neither was statistically significant.\nTable 3: Summary of the amphipod Ampelisca abdita sediment toxicity test results, initial\ntest sediment pore water ammonia concentrations, and test water ammonia\nconcentrations. Test water ammonia concentrations were the geometric mean of\nthe initial and final ammonia concentrations. Percent mortality results are an\naverage of replicate tests.\nPore Water Ammonia Conc.

Compared to their respective ERMs,\ncopper, lead, nickel and zinc were found at potentially toxic concentrations, with average\nTQs ranging from 1.89 for copper to 859 for lead.\nTable 4: List of 2005 sediment contaminants that demonstrated a statistically significant\npositive relationship between natural log transformed concentration and sediment\ntoxicity test percent mortality.\nContaminant (natural log Contaminant (natural log\np value p value\ntransformed) transformed)\nBis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate 0.0356 Copper 0.0332\nTotal PCBs 0.0430 Lead 0.0261\nArsenic 0.0497 Nickel 0.0318\nCadmium 0.0377 Zinc 0.0414\nChromium 0.0386\n6\nLegend\n% Mort\n100\n5 BEHP\nN Metal/loids\no\nr PCBs\nm\n4\n80 a\nliz\ne\ny 3 d\nali t\n60\nC\no\nt n\no r 2 e\nM n\nt\n%\nr\na\n40 1 t io\nn\n(\nm\n0\ng\n20\n/k\ng\n-1 )\n0 -2\nA E H J L R U 4th 6th 7th\nTransect\nFigure 7: Summary of the amphipod Ampelisca abdita sediment toxicity test results, with\ncomparisons to contaminants showing significant relationship to organism\nmortality.

Additionally, the high ammonia pore water concentrations,\nmeasured in toxicity test sediments, also support that CSOs could be the source of acute\nammonia toxicity in canal sediments.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 22 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n5.0 Evaluation of the Aquatic Biological\nPopulations\nThe invertebrate community from the Gowanus Canal, as represented by samples taken with\nthe Ponar and H-D samplers, included a total of 47 taxa in six phyla (Table 5) with most taxa\npreferring mesohaline environments. A few species which can exist in freshwaters were\nfound, including scuds or side swimmers (Gammarus) sp., and a shrimp (Palaemonetes\nvulgaris) (Voshell, 2002; Bousfield, 1973; Foster, 1976; Smith 2001).\n5.1 Benthic Community\nBiological data were used to further characterize the extant Gowanus Canal aquatic community\nwith respect to sample/transect location within the canal, local reference conditions, sediment\ncontamination, and physical habitat. Results indicated that the current ecological condition is\nbeing stressed by multiple chemical and physical stressors. Organic pollution tolerant organisms\ndominated the invertebrate community. Species richness was lower than referenced stressed\nNew York Harbor communities, which included a sewage impacted site. Although no clear cut\nchemical/invertebrate community metrics relationships were found, physical habitat\ncharacteristics such as sediment particle size, temperature, salinity, and D.O. seemed to drive the\nextant invertebrate distribution within the canal.\nBenthic data provided a robust dataset that was used to investigate relationships within and\nbetween transects with respect to local reference conditions and sediment contamination.\nInvertebrate population metrics used to evaluate community condition included species\nrichness and percent pollution tolerant taxa. These metrics were compared to Hudson\nEstuary reference conditions. These reference condition data originated from EPA’s\nRegional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (REMAP) data (Adams et al.\n1998). Although the benthic samples and GEI sediment collections were temporally\ndisconnected, correlations between benthic macroinvertebrate abundances and analyte\nconcentrations were also investigated.\nOverall, the benthic invertebrate community strongly represents an estuarine community\nhighly tolerant of organic pollution, with most taxa preferring mesohaline environments. A\nfew species which can exist in freshwaters were found. Nematoda, which were abundant\nthroughout the canal, as a group are nearly ubiquitous in their distribution with widespread\necological preferences and pollution tolerance. Likewise, the freshwater aquatic worms (i.e.,\nOligochaeta) and flatworms (i.e., Platyhelminthes) are ubiquitous in their distribution, and as\na group prefer soft substrates and are fairly tolerant of high levels of organic matter. A few\nspecies which can exist in freshwaters were found, including scuds or side swimmers\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 23 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n(Gammarus) and a shrimp (Palaemonetes vulgaris) (Voshell, 2002; Bousfield, 1973; Foster,\n1976; Smith, 2001).\nTable 5: List of taxa collected in Ponar and Hester-Dendy (H-D) samples in Gowanus Canal.\nPhylum/Class Class/Order Family Taxon Type of Sample\nNematoda Nematoda Both\nAnnelida Oligochaeta Oligochaeta Ponar\nPolychaeta Polychaeta H-D\nCapitellidae Capitellidae H-D\nCapitella sp.

Ten of the 15 H-D samplers were recovered and\ninvertebrates identified after three collection periods that spanned 224 days. There was\nconsiderable variability in densities among reaches, with a total of 29 taxa collected,\nincluding polychaetes, crustaceans (amphipods, decapods, isopods, thoracica (barnacles),\nbryazoans, mollusca, nematode, and platyhelminthes (Table 5). All of these species are\ncommon throughout the harbor.\nThe greatest densities were reported after 7 months of exposure. The plates retrieved in\nDecember had relatively few settled organisms compared to those collected in other months.\nHighest densities occurred in June after 7 months of exposure, and successive patterns of\ncolonization were demonstrated in all reaches. Taxa in the H-D samplers included primarily\namphipods, which generally prefer to build mud tubes on hard substrates. Nearly all of the\ntaxa collected prefer shallow waters <20 m in depth (Bousfield, 1973). Tube dwelling\namphipods and polychaetes were the dominant organisms in all reaches.\nSpecies abundance was low in comparison to a typical epibenthic community in the open\nwaters of the harbor, and the community was dominated by opportunistic species that are\ncommon in disturbed habitats and are considered organic pollution tolerant. The absence of\nthe amphipod Ampelesca abdita on the plates indicates that epibenthic community is\ndegraded. This species is common in the harbor but is susceptible to pollution and has\nlimited mobility. Lawler et al., 2004 concluded the epibenthic community living in the canal\nis an impoverished community with low complexity and diversity when compared to\nestablished epibenthic communities inhabiting hard surfaces in the East River. D.O. is a\ncritical factor for the establishment of epibenthic community. Extended periods of decreased\nD.O. can limit species diversity. The D.O. levels have been observed below 3 mg/L during\nthe GEI investigation and by Hazen and Sawyer, 2001.\n5.3 Fish and Crab Community\nLawler et al. (2004) provided seasonal data on adult fish, ichthyoplankton, and invertebrate\ncommunities from October 2003 to June 2004. From these data general species assemblages\nwere identified.\nAdult fish were sampled throughout five reaches within the Gowanus Canal and Bay over\nfour seasonal sampling periods from October 2003 through June 2004 (Lawler et al. 2004).\nFish were sampled via trap nets at the three upstream reaches, and by otter trawl tows in the\ntwo downstream reaches. Fish were identified and enumerated, to provide Capture per Unit\nEffort (CPUE) data. All or a minimum of 20 fish from each species at each site were\nmeasured. Ten species were collected: white perch, Atlantic silversides, striped bass,\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 25 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\ncunner, American eels, northern puffer, winter flounder, bay anchovies, spotted hake, and\nAtlantic tomcod. Blue crabs were also collected. All were collected at low abundances.\nSpecies richness values were generally greater in the bay versus the canal. Striped bass were\nthe most common fish species collected. Average monthly fish CPUE ranged from 0 to\n77.24 (all species combined).\nIchthyoplankton were sampled throughout five reaches within the Gowanus Canal and Bay\nby plankton net over four seasonal sampling periods from October 2003 to June 2004\n(Lawler et al. 2004). All fish larvae and eggs collected were identified, assigned a life stage\n(when possible), and enumerated. Twenty samples were collected with 14 species identified\n(bay anchovy, Atlantic menhaden, windowpane, labridae, grubby, Atlantic herring, Atlantic\nmackerel, weakfish, Atlantic croaker, winter flounder, unidentified gadid, tautog, northern\npipefish, and Atlantic silversides). Dominant egg and yolk sac larvae species collected was\nbay anchovy. Post yolk sac larvae had the highest species diversity of all life stages, with 12\nspecies collected (winter flounder were most abundant in March, and bay anchovies were the\nmost abundant in June). Monthly average ichthyoplankton densities ranged from 0 to\n8,635/1000 m3. Limited spawning occurs in the Canal, with more likely occurring in the\nBay. The few eggs collected in the Canal were dominated by pelagic species, indicating that\nthe eggs likely drifted, possibly by being drawn into the Canal from the Buttermilk Channel\nthrough the flushing tunnel or from the bay via the incoming tide. No winter flounder eggs\nwere collected, only post sac larval stages, so it is unclear if winter flounder are spawning in\nthe canal or if those collected were transported from the Bay or flushing tunnel.\nIn summary, the fish collected were dominated by migratory species that are common in the\nHarbor and Mid-Atlantic estuaries, with few resident fish (cunner, tautog) collected;\nindicating that the habitat necessary to support a resident fish community may not be present.\nThe canal has undergone extensive urbanization/industrialization, which has resulted in loss\nof aquatic habitat and poor water quality. Urbanization of the canal has created abiotic\nobstacles (e.g., low D.O., high temperatures) to the establishment of a resident fish\ncommunity.\nEighteen crab pots were retrieved. The most abundant taxa of crabs, the Pacific shore crabs,\nare opportunistic omnivores that can tolerate wide ranges of temperatures and salinities. It is\na potential competitor for other native species common to the area, as well as the non-native\ngreen crab. Other species collected included green crabs and bay mud crabs. Several fish\nwere also collected in the crab traps, including winter flounder, black sea bass, cunner,\nAmerican eels, northern searobins, and mummichogs. No crabs were collected in Reaches 2\nand 3 and none were collected during fall and spring surveys.\nDue to the limited number of ichthyoplankton, adult fish, and crab sites we did not\nquantitatively investigate relationships between sampling results and physical/chemical\nstressors. Additionally, data were collected using multiple methods that could bias results\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 26 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nand affect statistical assumptions. Regardless, general conclusions on the distribution can be\nmade using the available data. Generally, transects near the lower (Gowanus Bay) and upper\n(flushing tunnel) canal reaches had the greatest densities of ichthyoplankton, adult fish, and\ncrab. The greatest number of adult fish species (3) were found in transects near Gowanus\nBay and in Transect N. Additionally, the greatest relative adult fish density (measured by\nrespective CPUE) was found in upper reaches of the canal. The greatest crab diversity and\ndensity was found in Transect C, which is relatively close to the flushing tunnel.\nThese results support that the Gowanus Bay and flushing tunnel could be potential sources\nfor larval and adult fish sampled in the canal. However, these results also support that except\nfor the bay, the ecological community is dependant upon the operation of the flushing tunnel.\nAdditionally, improvements in water quality associated with tidal or tunnel exchange could\ninfluence distribution of mobile fish and crab species within the canal. These results are\nsimilar to those made by other researchers, which concluded that D.O. levels are thought to\nbe a limiting factor in the epibenthic macroinvertebrate populations.\n5.4 Analyses of Trends in the Benthic Community\n5.4.1 Cluster Analyses\nCluster analysis (group average of Euclidean distances) was performed on community\ncomposition (presence/absence) data (Hintze, 2003) using only the Ponar collected dataset.\nThe H-D dataset was not separately analyzed due to the limited number of canal sites\nsampled that could be matched to GEI transects.\nWhen only the benthic invertebrate data from benthic samples were clustered, results\neffectively demonstrate that the benthic invertebrate community can be broken into 5 distinct\nclusters, with dissimilarity between clusters ≥55 percent (Figure 8). These five clusters were\nfurther evaluated to determine if additional trends within the invertebrate community could\nbe identified.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 27 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nSite\nPonar U Cluster 1\nPonar J\nPonar N Cluster 2\nPonar W\nPonar G\nPonar 7\nPonar D\nCluster 3\nPonar P\nPonar A\nPonar 4\nPonar R\nPonar 6\nCluster 4\nPonar Z\nPonar Y\nCluster 5\nPonar AA\n1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00\nDissimilarity\nFigure 8: Cluster analysis, based from benthic invertebrate presence/absence data, of\ntransects from benthic samples collected in Gowanus Canal. Five distinct clusters\nwere identified with respect to dissimilarity between clusters ≥55%.\nCluster 1 contained only one transect. No invertebrates were found in samples from Transect\nU making it the least diverse of all clusters. Cluster 2, which included Transects N, J, and W,\nhad few Nematoda and Oligochaeta, with no other taxa. Cluster 3 contained more transects\nthan any other cluster, Transects A, D, G, P, R, 4th St, and 7th St. This cluster had more\nNematoda and Oligochaeta than Cluster 2, but included Capitella capitata (Polychaete) and\nthree species of amphipods, which were not identified at any other transects. This was the\nsecond most diverse cluster. Transect Z and the 6th Street basin was represented in Cluster\n4. Cluster 4 was dominated by Nematoda, Oligochaeta, and Polychaeta (multiple species).\nMore nematodes and oligochaetes were identified in Cluster 4 transects than any other\ncluster. Organic matter and sand (30 percent) is present at the 6th street basin and may be\nresponsible for the community composition. The USACE sampled adjacent to the pier at\nTransect Z and therefore more marine polychaetes would be expected. Cluster 5 was most\ndiverse. When Transects Y and AA were condensed, 15 taxa were identified. Most of these\ntaxa were Nematoda, Oligochaeta, and Polychaeta, but a few Mollusca (mussels/snails) and\nDecapoda (crabs) were also found. In summary, transects were grouped (clustered) with\nrespect to increasing species or taxa richness.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 28 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nUsing the clustered invertebrate communities we investigated trends in chemical and\nphysical datasets that matched the grouped transects. No clear cut relationships were\nidentified between cluster condensed metrics and chemical stressors in the sediments,\npossibly a result of the already low number of taxa present and indicating a stressed\ncommunity.\nAlthough chemical stressor relationships were poor, clustered results seemed to be correlated\nwith physico-chemical conditions (Figure 9), such as temperature, salinity, D.O., and\nsubstrate particle size. These data were collected concurrently with invertebrate sampling\nand best reflect the physical condition of the Gowanus Canal when invertebrate communities\nwere sampled. Clusters 3 and 5, which had the greatest species richness, also contained\ngravel sized particles. Cluster 5 contains transects closest to Gowanus Bay. Cluster 1, which\nhad no species present, had high percent silt and clay relative to the more diverse sites.\nLower temperature, higher salinity, and higher D.O. were all associated with greater species\nrichness. In total, these results indicate that within the impoverished, organic pollution\ntolerant invertebrate community able to inhabit Gowanus Canal, physical habitat condition\nhas more of an influence on resulting species richness than chemical stressors.\nLower Higher Lower Lower\nDiversity Temp Salinity D.O.\nCluster 1 – Transect U 0\n2\nCluster 2 – Transects N, J, and W\n5\nCluster 3 – Transects A, D, G,\nP, R, 4th St, and 7th St\n9\nCluster 4 – Z and 6th St\n15\nCluster 5 – Transects Y and AA\nGreater Lower Higher Higher\nDiversity Temp Salinity D.O.\nFigure 9: Comparison of species richness (combined number of taxa) of cluster analysis\ngroupings with concurrently based water quality data.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 29 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n5.5 Comparison to Gowanus Canal “Flushing Tunnel Study”\nThe flushing tunnel was re-activated in early March of 1999. To measure the effectiveness\nof the flushing tunnel on restoring the canal’s benthic community, benthic organisms were\ncollected monthly from March 1999 through February 2000 by Hazen and Sawyer (2001) on\nbehalf of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP). The\nbenthic sampling locations included Station 1) head of the canal, 2) 4th Street Turning basin,\n3) Hamilton Avenue, and 4) mouth of Gowanus Bay. USACE data, represented by GEI\nTransects A, J, and W/X, directly correlate to the NYCDEP Stations 1, 2, and 3 sampled in\n1999. However, the USACE study did not place a transect in Gowanus Bay; therefore, no\ncomparisons is made to NYCDEP Station 4. USACE collected benthic organisms in April of\n2003. Therefore, the February 2000 results of the NYCDEP survey were compared to the\nUSACE results to provide before and after comparison survey.\nThe NYCDEP results indicated that polychaete worms comprised 100 percent of the\norganisms collected at Stations 2 and 3. Approximately 97 percent of the polychaete worms\nwere Capitella capitata. Approximately 3,600 organisms/m2 were collected at Station 3,\nconsisting of 8 species of polychaete worms (65 percent Capitella capitata). At Station No.\n1, 15 percent of polychaete worms comprised the community in April 1999. The NYCDEP\nsurvey concluded that the canal did not have a stable benthic community as of February\n2000, in terms of the number of organisms and species. The presence of Capitella capitata\nand Streblospio benedicti in high numbers represented a successional benthic community.\nThe macroinvertebrate results of the NYCDEP 1999-2000 survey were compared to USACE\nstudy conducted in 2003, as summarized above. The purpose was to assess if the benthic\ncommunities exhibited signs of recovery 5 years after the flushing tunnel’s re-activation.\nBoth NYCDEP and USACE sampling events used the same equipment, a petite Ponar grab\nsampler. The processing of the benthic macroinvertebrate samples was also similar between\nthe NYCDEP survey and USACE 2003 sampling event. One difference between the studies\nwas the number of replicates sampled per site (two replicates for the USACE study vs. five\nreplicates in the NYCDEP study).\nThe mean number of benthic macroinvertebrate species (taxa) identified at the stations in the\n2003 USACE sampling was again lower compared to 5 years earlier (Figure 11). However,\nthe USACE only collected two replicates per transect or benthic sample. At each NYCDEP\nstation, five replicate samples were collected. The number of replicates may account for a\nportion of the temporal difference in canal species richness measurements.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 30 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n90000\n80000\nr\ne\nt\ne 70000\nm\nq . 60000\ns\nr 50000\ne\np\ns 40000\nm\ns 30000\ni\nn\na\ng 20000\nr\nO\n10000\n0\nStation 1 Station 2 Station 3 Station 4 Transect A Transect J Transect W/X\n2000 Sampling Event Results 2003 Sampling Event Results\nFigure 10: Comparisons of density of benthic organisms (numbers per square meter) sampled\nat the New York City Department of Environmental Protection stations to the\ncorresponding USACE (per GEI transects) data from 2003.\n) 25\na\nx\na\nt\n(\ns 20\ne\ni\nc\ne\np\ns 15\nf\no\nr\ne\nb 10\nm\nu\nn\ne\n5\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\nA 0\nStation 1 Station 2 Station 3 Station 4 Transect A Transect J Transect W/X\n2000 Sampling Event Results 2003 Sampling Event Results\nFigure 11: Comparisons of mean number of species (taxa) for benthic organisms sampled at\nthe New York City Department of Environmental Protection stations to the\ncorresponding USACE (per GEI transects) data from 2003.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 31 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nIn 2003, there was approximately a 50 percent decrease in the percentage of polychaetes at\nTransect A when compared to Station 1 sampled in February 2000 (Figure 12).

The objectives were to:\n1. Identify if there are any similarities between the canal communities with other\nimpaired or stressed communities in the New York Harbor system in terms of species\ncomposition or biotic metrics measuring impacts to the communities.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 32 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n2. Determine if the impairment to the NY Harbor benthic communities were attributed\nto chemical stressors or physical habitats that were documented in sediments.\n3. Make interferences with other harbor studies that investigated the effects of organic\nenrichment associated with sewage on marine benthic communities.\nGEI’s evaluation of the benthic invertebrate community structure using the USACE species\ndata revealed that the communities are impaired to various degrees. Observations of the\nGowanus Canal benthic communities included:\n• Oligochaeta was the most abundant family found in the USACE benthic samples.\nThis family is ubiquitous in distribution and as a group prefers soft substrates\n(Barnes, 1978). Oligochaetes are an important indicator of pollution because of\ntheir tolerance to organic enrichment. In enriched or oxygen-deficient areas, there\nare typically high densities of oligochaetes. Virginian Province Environmental\nMonitoring Assessment Program (EMAP) uses the number of oligochaetes per\nsampling event to assess environmental stress (EPA, 2000).\n• In GEI’s benthic community analysis, Streblospio benedicti was primarily found\nin Cluster 4 and Capitella was found in Cluster 3 and 4. EMAP also considers\nCapitella as a pollution indicative organism (EPA, 2000). Capitellids are\nparticularly tolerant to organic pollution (Olson and Fredick 1967). In the canal,\nspecies richness was comprised primarily of polychaete worms. These\ninvertebrates generally prefer the soft, muddy substrates. Polychaete distributions\nand dominance patterns are used as indicators of pollution (Olson and Fredick,\n1967).\n• Nematods are nearly ubiquitous in their distribution in the canal and have\nwidespread ecological preferences and pollution tolerances.\nCauses for the impairment within the five different clusters identified in Figure 8 using\ncluster analysis, which included elevated ambient water temperature, low D.O. in water\n(Figure 9), and poor substrate for colonization (high silt content and total organic carbon).\nThese results are similar to findings from studies of nearby systems, as summarized below.\n5.5.1.1 Adams et al., 1998 Sediment Quality of the NY/NJ Harbor System\nAs noted earlier, GEI’s assessment demonstrated that non-PAH chemicals exceeded\nsediment benchmarks at a significantly higher frequency than PAHs (Figure 1) in Gowanus\nCanal. Additionally, benthic community compositions within the canal showed that\nsewage/organic pollution tolerant organisms dominate the canal benthic communities.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 33 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nBecause only impaired communities were found in the canal, a reference community was not\navailable to directly evaluate the possible causal relationships between sediment\ncontamination and benthic community metrics in the Gowanus Canal. However, as part of a\nEPA REMAP study, Adams et al. (1998) identified non-impaired benthic communities in the\nNY Harbor system. They determined that 3 benthic metrics, abundance (decrease), species\nrichness (decrease), and percent pollution tolerant species (increase), could be correlated to\nsediment chemistry when 6 or more chemicals exceeded National Oceanic Atmospheric\nAdministration ERMs. This was observed throughout the entire NY harbor system and each\nof three subbasins (Upper Harbor, Lower Harbor, Jamaica Bay). This relationship was most\noften found for 3 contaminants: chlordane, PCBs, and mercury.\nA multi-metric benthic index of biotic integrity was developed for the NY Harbor and used\nto determine benthic impacts. The six metrics used included species richness, species\ndiversity, biomass, percent abundance as pollution sensitive taxa, percent of abundance as\npollution-tolerant taxa, and percent of abundance as carnivores/omnivores. Measurable\nbenthic impacts were most widespread in Upper Harbor and Jamaica Bay. The distribution\nof individual stations with impacted benthos shows the most highly impacted sites were in\nthe backbay of Jamaica Bay.\nREMAP noted that pollution tolerant species were common in the backbay portion of\nJamaica Bay, which is in the vicinity of 26th Ward Point Waste Water Treatment Plant. The\nREMAP’s Jamaica Bay results showed evident pollution influence on benthic structure was\nassociated with total organic carbon. Figure 13 compares the average number of taxa\nmeasured for Gowanus Canal transects compared to the 3 REMAP basins.\nWhen the relative numbers of pollution tolerant taxa are compared to REMAP sites (Figure\n14), Gowanus Canal is quite similar to two of the three REMAP sites, including Jamaica\nBay. Together these results indicate that the number of species in the Gowanus invertebrate\ncommunity is very low, even when compared to local impaired communities, while the\nspecies that are present have a similar pollution tolerance.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 34 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n25\nREMAP\nStudy Sites\na 20\nx\na\nsT\ne\ns\no f\nRi c h n m b e r 15\ns u\neN 10\nci\ne\neg\npa\nSr\ne\nv 5\nA\n0\nA D G J N P R U W Y Z\nA\nA\n4t h\nSt.\n6t h\nSt.\n7t h\nSt.\nH ar b\nor\nW W T\nP)\nH ar b\nor\nTransect\nU p p\ner\na\nB a y\n(\nL o w\ner\nc\nai\nm\na\nJ\nFigure 13: Gowanus Canal transect specific average number of taxa compared to local\ncommunities.

However, sediments from only a relatively small\narea of the Harbor (15 percent) caused reduced laboratory survival of A. abdita. The\nREMAP study found that metals present at > ERM were most often associated with A. abdita\ntoxicity for the Harbor system. GEI conducted a similar evaluation using USACE A. abdita\ntoxicity testing results (percent survival) and 2005 sediment data. Nine natural log\ntransformed variables, mostly metals, demonstrated a statistically significant negative\nrelationship with percent survival (Table 1).\nThe REMAP studies indicated that the sediment toxicity test was a less sensitive indicator of\nsediment quality than ERM sediment chemistry concentration evaluations or invertebrate\ncommunity structure. These findings indicated that benthic structure was measurably\nimpacted, and was predictable by chemical contamination, before acute toxicity of A. abdita\nbecame evident. Given both ERM exceedances and A. abita toxicity were significant in\nGowanus Canal, this confirms the findings of impaired benthic communities in the canal.\n5.5.1.2 Benthic Habitats of New York/ New Jersey Harbor\nA survey of benthic habitats was conducted in Jamaica Bay, Upper Bay, Newark Bay,\nBowery Bay, and Flushing Bay (Iocco, et al. 2000). The objective of the survey was to map\nbenthic (bottom) habitats in New York/New Jersey Harbor in a geographic information\nsystem (GIS) using sediment profiling imagery (SPI) and grab sampling. The maps\ndeveloped identified benthic habitat types and their distribution, and were used to document\nhabitat variability.\nIn October 1994, the USACE began collecting these data using traditional benthic sampling\nmethods and SPI remote sensing techniques. The habitat classification system was\ndeveloped for New York/New Jersey Harbor and was based on sediment type and observed\nfaunal assemblages. Twenty-one habitat classes were identified in this study. Figure 15\ncompares species richness per Gowanus Canal transect to the 4 bays that were sampled in the\nbenthic habitat study. The species richness found at the canal transects were less than the\nspecies richness for all 4 bays.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 36 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n30\n25\na\nx\na\nT\nf 20\no\nr\ne\nb\nm 15\nu\nN\ne\ng 10\na\nr\ne\nv\nA 5\n0\nA D G J N P R U W Y Y Z\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n4t h\nSt.\n4t h\nSt.\n6t h\nSt.\n7t h\nSt.\nFl u s hi n\ng\nB a\ny\nB o w er\ny\nB a\ny\nB a y ( W\nW\nT\nP)\nU p p\ner\nB a\ny\nTransect a\nc\nai\nm\na\nJ\nFigure 15: Comparison of species richness at transects in Gowanus Canal with New York/New\nJersey Harbor bays sampled by USACE in 1994 (Iocco et al, 2000).\nIn general, the benthic habitat survey found that benthic habitats in each bay were dominated\nby opportunistic or organic pollution tolerant species. Oligochaetes were often identified in\nthe survey and are an indicator of pollution because of their tolerance to organic enrichment.\nThey were also living in the sediment of the Gowanus Canal. The average number of\noligochaetes was calculated for each of the 4 bays (Flushing Bay, Bowery Bay, Jamaica Bay,\nand Upper Bay) and compared to the canal (Figure 16). Nine transects within Gowanus\nCanal had stations where oligochaetes were more abundant when compared to the four bays.\nBecause Streblospio benedicti was one of the polychaetes species identified both the NY/NJ\nharbor survey and in Gowanus Canal, GEI compared the abundances of S. benedicti found at\nthe different canal transects to the abundances of this species reported in the 4 bay areas\n(Figure 17). The polychaete worm, S. benedicti, can survive in highly enriched sediments\nbecause it has gills that protrude a few hundred micrometers (µm) from the sediment-water\ninterface. The data indicates that some individuals of S. benedicti have been able to colonize\nsome sections of the canal, but not all. The number of individuals in the canal is still lower\nthan the four other bays. In the NY/NJ harbor survey, polychaete distributions and\ndominance patterns were often used as indicators of pollution, as many species (including\nS. benedicti) are relatively tolerant to high levels of pollution. Pollution-tolerant polychaetes\nremain in areas where more sensitive species have left or died. Recolonization by most\npolychaetes can occur in less than a month, but some studies have indicated that several\nmonths to a year may be needed.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 37 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n140\na\ne t 120\na\nh\nc\no 100\ng\nOli\nf 80\no\nr\ne\nb 60\nm\nu\nN\ne\n40\ng\na\ne r 20\nv\nA\n0\nA D G J N P R U W Y Y Z\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n4t h\nSt.\n4t h\nSt.\n6t h\nSt.\n7t h\nSt.\nFl u s hi n g B a\ny\nB o w er y B a\ny\nB a y ( W W T\nP)\nU p p er B a\ny\nTransect a\nc\nai\nm\na\nJ\nFigure 16: Comparison of numbers of oligochaetes at transects in Gowanus Canal with New\nYork/New Jersey Harbor bays sampled by USACE in 1994 (Iocco et al, 2000).\nti 70\nc\ndi\ne 60\nn\ne\nb\no 50\npi\ns\no\nbl 40\ne\nr\nt\nS\n30\nr\ne\nb\nm\n20\nu\nN\ne\ng 10\na\nr\ne\nv 0\nA\nA D G J N P R U W Y Y Z\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n4t h\nSt.\n4t h\nSt.\n6t h\nSt.\n7t h\nSt.\nFl u s hi n\ng\nB a\ny\nB o w er\ny\nB a\ny\nB a y ( W\nW\nT\nP)\nU p p\ner\nB a\ny\nTransect a\nc\nai\nm\na\nJ\nFigure 17: Comparison of numbers of the polychaete worm, Streblospio benedicti, at transects\nin Gowanus Canal with New York/New Jersey Harbor bays sampled by USACE in\n1994 (Iocco et al, 2000).\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 38 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n5.5.1.3 Gallagher, 1998 Organism-Sediment-Contaminant Interactions in Boston Harbor\nBenthic community monitoring is being conducted by Massachusetts Water Resource\nAuthority as part of its outfall monitoring program. A study was conducted that investigated\nbenthic communities of Boston Harbor and their relationship to contaminants and organic\nenrichment observed in the harbor. The major effect of pollution on Boston Harbor\ncommunity structure is that species, normally found only in intertidal or low salinity habitats,\ndominate Boston Harbor’s contaminated subtidal habitats. In addition, the most\ncontaminated sediments contain high frequency of several polychaete worms (Capitella).\nCapitella were found in only the most organically enriched sediments. Many subtidal areas\nof Boston Harbor were dominated by oligochaete worms, and the spionid polychaetes, S.\nbenedicti and Polydora cornuta. This would be a typical benthic community if salinities\nwere low (15 to 20 parts per thousand [ppt]) or variable, but it is highly atypical for the high\nsalinities (about 28 ppt) found in Boston Harbor.\nA high frequency of Capitella or S. benedicti in Boston Harbor’s sub tidal sediments is a\nstrong indicator of organic enrichment or contamination. In Gowanus Canal, Capitella was\npresent at 13 of 28 transects sampled by USACE. Capitella rarely occurs in high numbers\nwith other species; thus, the other 15 transects where Capitella was not present might be due\nto competition by other species such as spionids. The polluted end point of organic\nenrichment gradient is identified by either highly organic, fine sediment with low numbers of\norganisms (i.e., Cluster 1 at Transect U of the canal noted above) or a community dominated\nwith high frequency of Capitella (Clusters 3, representing Transects A, D, G, P, R, 4th St,\nand 7th St, and Cluster 4, representing Transect Z and the 6th Street basin). The next\nsuccessional stage in organically enriched in subtidal areas that will replace Capitella include\nS. benedicti, P. cornuta, and oligochaetes.\n5.6 Comparisons to Sediment Contaminants\nTo investigate trends in the extant invertebrate community with respect to chemical stressors,\ninvertebrate metrics were compared to GEI sediment data. No biologically significant\nconclusions could be made when invertebrate metrics were compared to GEI sediment data.\nNematode and Oligochaete abundances drove most all of the invertebrate metric endpoints\nand most trends were positive, indicating that the increasing concentrations of contaminants\nwere correlated to greater invertebrate density and species richness. These contradictory\nresults might be due to the low invertebrate richness resulting from the chemical stressors\nnoted earlier, limiting identification of a true response. Species that are present are tolerant\nto organic pollution and it is likely that the community does not respond to contamination in\nthe same manner as would a more diverse and sensitive assemblage.\nA total of 54 contaminants and 7 habitat variables from the 2006 GEI sediment sampling\nanalyte results were regressed against total density, diversity (H’), number of taxa, nematode\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 39 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nabundance, oligochaete abundance, and Capitellidae abundance. For this analysis, both\nbenthic and epibenthic invertebrate communities were combined and normalized to the\n“family” level of identification to allow use of the most diverse list of taxa. Contaminant and\nphysical parameter results were natural log normalized to better meet normality assumptions.\nDiversity and total number of taxa were positively correlated with BTEX compounds, and\nCapitellidae abundance was negatively correlated. Total density, number of taxa, nematode\nabundance, and oligochaete abundance were positively correlated with every PAH. The\nrelationship was statistically significant for number of taxa vs. PAH results only. Diversity\nwas negatively correlated with all of the PAHs, but none were statistically significant. Total\ndensity, nematode abundance and oligochaete abundance were positively correlated with\nsediment metal results, but this relationship was only statistically significant between select\nmetals and oligochaete abundance. Nematode and oligochaete abundance were positively\ncorrelated with PCBs and pesticides. No clear or consistent patterns were identified in\ndiversity and Capitellidae abundance with respect to metal concentration.\nIn summary, nematode and oligochaete abundances appear to be driving the total density and\nnumber of taxa biological endpoints, as all four metrics show similar relationships with\ncontaminant results. Nematode and oligochaete seem to be tolerant of most all contaminants,\nwith the exception of benzene. On the other hand, Capitellidae abundance seems to be the\nleast tolerant of most all of the contaminants, with the exception of a few PAHs and metals.\nDiversity seems to be sensitive to PAHs, but no consistent patterns were identified with other\ncontaminants.\nTo investigate physical habitat influences on the extant invertebrate community, we also\ncompared abundance of abundant invertebrate taxa to 2006 matched transect data. The\nCorophiidae and the Capitellidae abundances were positively correlated with percent sand.\nAverage number of taxa was negatively correlated with fine grained sediments (percent silt\nand clay). Interestingly, the opposite relationship was found between density and fine\nsediments. These results are consistent with REMAP comparisons, in that the invertebrate\nspecies richness is independent from species abundances. Gravel was rarely observed in\nGowanus sediments, but at transects in which it was measured species richness was generally\ngreater. These relationships between physical habitat and invertebrate metrics support our\ncluster analysis results that identified habitat conditions as the probable drivers in Gowanus\nCanal invertebrate communities.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 40 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n6.0 Summary and Conclusions\nIn conclusion, results from this study support that sediments are toxic due to multiple\nchemical stressors. These stressors include metals, PCBs, pesticides, and to a lesser extent\nPAHs. Using water quality standards and sediment benchmarks, established to protect fish\nsurvival, we were able to identify the frequency and predict the magnitude of toxicity of\nwater column and surficial sediments to aquatic organism. Although PAHs had little impact\non water quality, the magnitude of potential impacts in sediments from chemical stressors\nwas substantial, even without considering PAHs. Outfalls were also identified as a\npotentially significant source of sediment contamination from metals, pesticides, and PCBs.\nThe predicted toxicity of canal sediments was validated in laboratory toxicity testing, with\nclear relationships seen between test organism mortality and non-PAH contaminants.\nAnalyses investigating invertebrate abundance and richness metrics with respect to reference\nsites from other waters, sediment contamination, and habitat revealed that the Gowanus\nCanal invertebrates are severely limited.\nFish and crab were also observed in the canal. The fish community was dominated by\nmigratory species that are common in the Harbor and Mid-Atlantic estuaries, suggesting that\nthe habitat necessary to support a non-migratory resident fish community may not be present.\nThe distributions of larval fish, adult fish, and crabs within the canal seemed to correlate with\nproximity to the flushing tunnel or Gowanus Bay. This observation supports that the\nGowanus Bay and flushing tunnel could be potential sources for larval and adult fish sampled\nin the canal. Additionally, improvements in water quality associated with tidal or tunnel\nexchange could influence distribution of mobile fish and crab species within the canal. These\nresults are similar to those made by original researchers, which concluded that D.O. levels\nare thought to be a limiting factor in the epibenthic macroinvertebrate populations.\nTo establish the ecological condition of the Gowanus Canal with respect to temporal, local,\nand regional data, we compared our results to referenced conditions reported by other\nresearchers. When we investigated potential flushing tunnel benefits it was clear that the\nbenthic macroinvertebrate communities throughout the canal are not showing signs of\nrecovery and it appears the communities have further degraded since February 2000. When\nGowanus canal sites were compared to local impaired REMAP sites, results indicated that\nthe number of species in the Gowanus invertebrate community is very low while the species\nthat are present have a similar pollution tolerance. When Gowanus Canal benthic\nmacroinvertebrate communities were compared to regionally conducted surveys,\nsuccessional distributions of oligochaetes and polychaetes were identified. High numbers of\noligochaetes and low numbers of polychaetes further support that organic enrichment from\nsewage/CSO discharges in the canal results in a opportunistic or pollution tolerant\ninvertebrate community.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 41 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\nIn summary, the current Gowanus Canal ecology is very limited by a combination of\nchemical contamination, organic (sewage) pollution, and poor physical habitat, much of\nwhich could be artifacts of CSO effluent impacts.\nGEI Consultants, Inc. 42 December 2009\nChadwick Ecological Division Gowanus Canal Ecological Report\n7.0 References\nAdams.

These data were collected at all sediment depths. Because we are interested in\necological effects of sediment exposure, only surficial sediments (0-3 ft) were analyzed.\nBenthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms would not be expected to inhabit deeper sediments.\nThe 0 to 3 ft sediment sampling depth interval is consistent with reference burrowing depths\nfor Boston Harbor deep burrowing organisms (Kropp and Diaz, 1995).\nTo extrapolate surficial sediments from the entire 2006 sediment dataset, we averaged the\nlower and upper sediment sample depth that was recoded for samples 1 through 103. Using\nthis average depth value, each sediment sample was coded into three depth categories (1 = 0-\n3 ft, 2 = 3.1-11 ft, and 3 = > 11.1 ft).\nOnce the 0 to 3 ft interval surficial sediment dataset was extracted, data identifiers were\nmanaged. For example, coded text data identifiers define if the results were an estimated\nvalue (J) and/or undefined (U). To develop a working dataset with measured values we\nremoved the U, J, and UJ codes when in the same cell as the analytical results. The data with\nJ identifiers (“estimated value”) were deleted from working datasets, but were kept in raw\ndatasets. All data with UJ and U codes were changed to have a “less than” (<) symbol.\nModified identifiers were placed into a separate column (labeled “Sign”) directly to the left\nof the respective contaminant value column. Duplicate sediment results were averaged so\nthat one set of contaminant results represented a single sample station. There were 7\nduplicate water quality samples in the 2006 sediment dataset.\nTo produce a robust dataset with measured values for as many variables and sites as possible,\nwe performed a screening protocol. Screening consisted of manipulating non-detect values\nand deleting unreasonably high non-detect values from further analyses. Because this\nscreening process involved the consideration of measured values found within a particular\ncontaminant, only non-detects from significantly robust contaminants were manipulated.\nRobust contaminants consisted of measured values for most of the samples. It was important\nto identify the range in which contaminants were being measured to justify manipulating\nnon-detect values. If a non-detect value was found reasonable, with respect to other\nmeasured values, it was retained, divided in half, and an H was placed in the “sign” column\nnext to the new value. If the value was unreasonably high when compared to measured\nvalues, even after dividing in half, it was deleted and a D was placed into the respective\n“sign” column. Results from these data screens provided a subset of significant (or “data\nrobust”) variables with measured results that spanned all transects. It is important to note\nthat manipulating non-detect values was not performed on all contaminants, but only for\ncontaminants that were found at measurable levels at most sites.\nA-2\nAfter screening the database and transforming non-detect values, all remaining contaminant\nvalues from all samples were condensed into single values for each respective transect. This\nconsisted of averaging the two-to-three samples taken from each transect into a single\ntransect value. Because this methodology involved condensing measured, estimated, or\nretained non-detect values, a condensation protocol was developed. All measured values\nwere averaged. If all values for a particular contaminant were non-detects, the average non-\ndetect value was used for respective contaminant/transect entries. When one or more\nmeasured values were found along with non-detect values for a contaminant within a\ntransect, the non-detect value was ignored and the measured value or average of each\nmeasured value was represented in the transect. This method of condensing the raw data into\na single value for each transect yielded the most robust dataset with respect to measured\nvalues. Additionally, spatially normalizing all data to a specific transect was needed to\nsuccessfully compare historic sediment, water quality, toxicity test, and biological datasets.\nScreened and organized 2006 sediment data can be found in the attached tables. Two\ndatasets are presented. The non-condensed surficial sediment dataset shows all UJ's and U's\nthat were changed to a \"<\" and transformed non-detect value denoted with an “H”. The\nsecond is a working dataset that contains transect-condensed results, without the identifier\ncodes, and has a value in each transect for robust contaminants.\n2006 Water Quality Data\nThe 2006 water quality data was collected by GEI along the same transects established in the\n2006 sediment dataset. These data were collected at two depths, surface and at the sediment\nwater column interface. The 2006 water quality data was screened and organized similar to\nthe 2006 sediment data, with respect to screening and condensation into single values for\neach transect. For the water quality data, however, surface and bottom collected samples\nwere kept separate. The 2006 water quality datasets are presented in the attached tables,\nsimilar to the 2006 sediment dataset.\n2005 Sediment Data\nThe 2005 sediment data was obtained from available published reports. DMA, Inc. (2006)\ncollected sediment cores on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) using a\nVibracore device. Samples were collected at 10 locations within the canal in September\n2005, with locations chosen to fill data gaps in the understanding of sediment quality. Site\nlocations ranged from the upstream portion of the Gowanus canal to below the Carrol\nGardens/Public Place MGP site (but above the Metropolitan MGP site). Nine of the sites\nwere previous (2003) USACE locations. Samples were analyzed for metals, semi-volatile\norganic compounds (SVOCs), polychlorinated biphenyl’s (PCBs), pesticides, grain size, and\ntotal organic carbon (TOC) (See contaminant matrix, attached).\nA-3\nThe 2005 sediment data from DMA, Inc (2006) were entered into an Excel spreadsheet.\nThese historic sediment data were then organized into transects and matched to the nearest\nGEI transect. When more than one sample was placed into a single transect, analytical\nresults were averaged similarly to that described above, except that no transformation of non-\ndetect results was performed when preparing the datasets. Additionally, the 2005 sediment\ndataset results were converted from parts per billion (micrograms per kilogram [µg/kg]) to\nparts per million (milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) units, to normalize all datasets to similar\nmeasurement units. Similar to the GEI sediment and water quality datasets, two 2005\nsediment datasets are presented below. The raw dataset comprises the data entered into the\nExcel file as organized in the original report. The second is a working dataset, with results\nmatched to GEI transect locations and normalized to like measurement units.\nWe investigated, but did not use, analytical sediment data collected by the USACE in 2003.\nThose sediment data were sampled at multiple depths. Once categorized into depth\ncategories, we found that only two samples were collected from surficial (0-3 ft) sediments.\nDue to this limited surficial sampling results, the 2003 USACE sediment data was not used in\nour investigations.\nOutfall Effluent Data\nOutfall effluent water quality data were collected by GEI during a dry weather event between\nAugust 2 and 11, 2006. After reconnaissance to locate potential outfalls, combined sewer\noutfalls (CSOs) and unmarked outfalls were sampled. A total of 56 outfalls were sampled.\nWhen an outfall was actively discharging into the canal above the waterline, a water sample\nwas collected. This sample is representative of effluent. When an outfall discharged below\nthe water line, its activity was unknown. Even though a snap jar was used to collect a\nsubsurface water sample directly in the zone of effluent, the sample may have still\nrepresented a mix of effluent and canal water, if the outfall was flowing. Because of these\nuncertainties, only data from actively flowing outfalls sampled above the waterline were used\nin our analyses. This greatly reduced our database size to 11 outfalls, one of which was a\nCSO.\nUsing location notes and field technician assistance, each sample was matched to the nearest\nGEI transect. These data were organized and presented in the attached tables as for all other\ndatasets. It is important to note that it was not necessary to screen results and all data is\npresented as original measured values.\nSediment Toxicity Tests\nSediment toxicity tests were conducted on behalf of the USACE by AquaSurvey, Inc. (2005)\nand are presented in the DMA (2006) report. AquaSurvey, Inc. tested the toxicity of the\nsediments collected in September 2005 using the amphipod Ampelisca abdita in a 10-day\nA-4\nexposure, solid phase (whole sediment) bioassay. Five replicate chambers with 20 organisms\neach were used to characterize the toxicity of each sediment sample. Control sediments and\ntest organisms were obtained from a reference site, Sandy Hook, Atlantic Highlands, NJ.\nThe overlaying water was obtained from the Manasquan Inlet, Manasquan, NJ. Because of\ninitially high pore water ammonia concentrations, 9 of the 10 samples needed to be purged\nvia static renewal of overlying water until concentrations were below 20 mg/L.\nA series of four static or static renewal tests were run, with one test conducted as a static\nexposure test and the remaining three as static-renewal exposures. After 10 days of\nexposure, live count data were documented, as well as water quality and physical parameters.\nIt is important to note that there was a discrepancy in the sediment toxicity testing report\nwhere the site identification code for GC-26 was presumably mislabeled as GC-23. This was\ncorrected in our final toxicity test dataset, so that each site was matched to the same sediment\nsample analytical results.\nToxicity test results, water quality conditions, and notes are summarized in the toxicity test\ndataset found in the attached tables. Information on each of the 10 toxicity tests was\nrecorded into the dataset.\nBiological Data\nThree separate biological datasets were utilized in our investigations of the Gowanus Canal\necology. These datasets included data from 1) benthic, or bottom-dwelling, invertebrate\ncommunities, 2) water-column colonizing, or epibenthic invertebrate communities, and 3)\nfish trawl and fish/crab trap sampling efforts. Similar to the 2005 sediment data, raw data\nwere obtained from published Gowanus Canal sampling reports. A brief summary of each of\nthe datasets are provided below.\nBenthic Invertebrate Community\nA total of 29 Gowanus Canal and Bay benthic macroinvertebrate sampling sites were\nestablished by the USACE (2003). Station locations were recorded by GIS technology and\nlatitude/longitude coordinates were provided. Sampling was conducted on April 29 and 30\n2003. Invertebrates were collected using a petite Ponar benthic sampler. Two replicate\nbenthic grab samples were taken at by 28 Gowanus Canal or Bay stations and one control\nsample (no location given). Each sample was sealed in a 5 gallon bucket and sent to Atlantic\nReference Centre, New Brunswick, Canada, for analysis. Limited Hydrolab measured water\nquality parameters were recorded at each sample location.\nResults for each sample were provided. Values represented sample abundances for each\ntaxon. Provided latitude/longitude coordinates were used to identify site locations with\nrespect to GEI established transects locations. A total of 19 USACE sites were matched to\nA-5\n15 GEI transects. Gowanus Bay and unidentified site locations were not matched to transects\nand were discarded from further analyses.\nFor community cluster analyses, results from each replicate and sites within each transect\nwere added. Few transects contained data from more than one site. Transect AA contained\ndata from three USACE sites, Transect Y from two sites, and Transect 4th Street Turning\nbasin from two sites. The remaining 12 transects contained data from only one USACE sites.\nSince clustering was done on a presence/absence basis, summed abundances from more\nfrequently sampled transect locations did not bias results but provided species assemblages\noccurring at each transect location.\nFor all other analyses sample and replicate abundances were averaged. Therefore, each\ntransect invertebrate value is an average abundance for a representative benthic grab within\nthe transect location. Resultant values were kept as is (i.e. fractions) and were not rounded to\nthe nearest whole number.\nColonizing/Fouling Invertebrate Community\nThe second dataset was created from H-D colonized fouling community sampling. Fouling\ncommunity invertebrates were sampled at five locations in the Gowanus Canal and Bay using\nH-D style samplers (Lawler et al. 2004). These artificial substrate samplers were set up in\nOctober 2003 and collected at four time intervals (Table A-1). Three samplers placed at each\nlocation, with one collected during each retrieval period to provide species identifications\nand densities.\nEach H-D sampler consisted of nine 3 x 3 inch settling plates separated by two, three, or five\n1 inch diameters spacers. Samplers were suspended from the shoreline or a bulkhead below\nthe low tide mark. On the first survey in October, three samples were placed in each of the\nfive fixed stations. On each subsequent survey (December, March, and June) one sampler\nfrom each station was retrieved, placed on ice, and returned to the laboratory for analysis.\nTable A-1: Quarterly sample dates for the aquatic resource sampling component of the\nGowanus Bay and Canal Ecosystem Restoration Studies, October 2003 to June\n2004 (Lawler et al. 2004).\nSeasonal Sampling Period Sampling Dates # of Exposure Days\n1 October 22 – 23 0\n2 December 16 – 17 55\n3 March 31 – April 1 161\n4 June 2 – 3 224\nOnce in the laboratory each H-D sampler was immediately taken apart and plates were\nplaced in 10 percent formalin Rose Bengal solution for preservation. Each plate was scraped\nclean and only whole organisms or parts with heads attached were counted. Organisms were\nA-6\nidentified to the lowest taxonomic level practicable. Final abundance values were reported as\ndensities (number/m2).\nEach H-D sampler site location was identified with respect to GEI established transect\nlocations. The five sampler locations were matched to four Gowanus Canal transects. The\nremaining sampler location was in Gowanus Bay; therefore, it could not be matched to any\nGEI transects. Since each sampler was exposed to canal water for different durations, data\nwere condensed into a single transect result. When H-D data were used in cluster analyses\ntotal densities for each taxon were added within respective transects. Since cluster analyses\nwere conducted on a presence/absence basis, condensation results represented the total\nnumber of species that colonized the sampler over the course of the three exposure durations.\nAs described above, clustering was done on a presence/absence basis; therefore, summed\nabundances did not bias results but provided species assemblages occurring at each sample\nlocation.\nFish and Crab Community\nThe third dataset was a combination of the ichthyoplankton (larval fish suspended in the\nwater column), adult fish, and crab trap data collected in 2003 through 2004 using trap nets\nand trawl nets (Lawler et al. 2004). Results presented by the authors were matched to\nrespective transects. Similar results found for fish metrics between multiple transects\nindicate that a trawl path covered more than one transect location. Crab traps were set for 24\nhour period to provide catch per unit estimate (CPUE) data and species identifications. Since\nthese data were less robust and could not be easily matched to individual transects or abiotic\ndatasets, only qualitative summary results are presented.\nData Quality Assurance and Quality Control\nBecause extensive manipulation of raw data into working datasets was necessary, a quality\nassurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocol was established. Raw data from GEI\nanalytical analyses was assumed to be correct. Data identifiers were left in this Appendix\ndataset so proofreaders could follow our data manipulation steps. Data manipulation steps\nwere left as Excel formulas so that data condensation manipulations could be easily checked.\nSpot checks were conducted for roughly 20 percent of the data. If data discrepancies were\nidentified, then further spot checking and data validation steps were employed. Before and\nafter data were organized into statistical datasets, results were also subject to a QA/QC. For\ndata that were re-entered from report tables into Excel datasets, additional steps were taken to\nensure translation accuracy. This included double checking every entered value. These\nprotocols were performed by personnel that were not directly involved with creating the\ndatasets. All efforts were made to be as transparent as possible when creating all of the\nreport analyses datasets.\nA-7\nStatistical Analyses\nParametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed in our ecotoxicological\nevaluation of the Gowanus Canal. The exact test or analysis conducted is explained in\ngreater detail when presented, but general guidelines are discussed here. As part of every\nparametric statistical analysis, an “assumptions check” was conducted. The assumption of\nequal variance and/or normality was often violated (graphically analyzed) and improved\nupon after transformation of data. Data were assumed to be independent, within and between\ngroups being analyzed. Data were not randomly collected; therefore, our scope of inference\ncould not be extrapolated to processes occurring outside of the study area. For all analyses,\nsignificance relies on a sample distribution test statistic and sample size, with an alpha level\nof 0.05 used. All data analyses were conducted using NCSS 2004, SPSS 15.0, and\nCANOCO 4.5 for Windows software packages.\nIn conjunction with specific statistical comparisons, we performed extensive exploratory data\nanalyses (EDA). These EDA were important in initial data investigation and organization\ndue to the large number of multivariate parameters associated with investigating relationships\nbetween complex datasets.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA), all possible regression (APR), and Chi-squared\nautomatic interaction detection (CHAID) were all used to reduce respective dataset variables\nto those that contribute the most variance, while retaining characteristics of the dataset. First,\nPCA was used to find surrogates for variables that moved together. A list of 10 sediment and\nwater quality variables were identified (Table A-2) as surrogates for removed contaminant\nvariables (this analysis is important in reducing covariance between respective dependent\nvariables).\nTable A-2: Variables identified by PCA as potential surrogates to explain the most variability in\neach data set.\nBiological Sediment WQ Habitat\nOligochaeta Fluoranthene BTEX Sed Depth\nCapitellidae CarcPAHs Nitrate/Nitrite Sed Density\nSpionidae PCBs Salinity\nTotal Density Chlordane\nAverage # of Sp Cadmium\nH' Vanadium\nAPR was used to confirm PCA results by examining the variability that is explained by\naddition of model parameters (model parameters were selected according to PCA results).\nRegressions were performed for each robust invertebrate family or metric. CHAID was used\nto find possible subsets or contingent relationships within the data. This analysis was not\nrobust to the limited invertebrate data and was not useful. The above PCA and APR analyses\nwere run two times, once with separate iterations for each dataset separately and once using a\ncombined sediment/WQ dataset. A Pearson Correlation coefficient matrix was created for\nA-8\nidentified variables. Results backed up CCA results in identifying positive relationships\nbetween Nematode/ Oligochaete abundance and identified variables and the opposite\nrelationship between other invertebrate metrics. It is important to note that potentially\nsignificant relationships identified from EDA were backed up with appropriate parametric\ntests before being presented in report results.\nExploratory Data Analyses - CCA\nCanonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to analyze invertebrate family response\nto sediment and WQ results. CCA results indicated that most all of the contaminant classes\nare behaving similarly in the canal (i.e., all PAHs were similarly distributed with respect to\ntransect locations). CCA is a multivariate direct gradient analysis that is robust to skewed\nspecies distributions, with quantitative noise in species abundance data, with samples taken\nfrom unusual sampling designs, with highly intercorrelated environmental variables, and with\nsituations where not all of the factors determining species composition are known. Results\nfrom this nonparametric multivariate screening analysis are in the form of bi-plots.\nInterpretation of invertebrate family response to sediment and WQ results were made from\nusing bi-plot graphics.\nCCA identified unique correlations between nematodes and oligochaetes, but not the other\ninvertebrate families or metrics. Many contaminants were positively correlated with\nnematode and oligochaete abundance and the other invertebrate families showed little inverse\ncorrelation between abundance and contaminant concentration (e.g., total invertebrate\nabundance, nematodes, Gammarus, and oligochaetes were least sensitive to changes in\ncarcinogenic PAH concentrations and all other invertebrates were negatively correlated with\ncarcinogenic PAHs). These results directed our benthic invertebrate/contaminant statistical\nanalyses when investigating relationships between nematodes, oligochaetes, or similarly\nrobust invertebrate abundances and contaminant concentrations.\nDerivation of Sediment Thresholds\nFor many contaminants, low and median toxic effect estimates derived from field studies\nacross the nation were used to as surrogate sediment screening benchmarks. The Effects\nRange-Low (ERL) and Effects Range-Median (ERM) were established to indicate levels of\nsediment contamination that can be tolerated by the majority benthic organisms. Long et al.\n(1995) provide sediment threshold values for contaminants in marine and estuarine\nsediments, as presented in Tables 3 and 4 of the New York State Department of\nEnvironmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Technical Guidance Document (1999). Briefly, if\nthe concentration is greater than the ERL but less than the ERM, the sediment is considered\nto be “contaminated,” with moderate impacts to benthic life expected. If the concentration is\ngreater than the ERM, the sediment is “contaminated” and significant harm to benthic aquatic\nlife is anticipated (NYSDEC, 1999).\nA-9\nA number of contaminants do not have ERM values for evaluation of potential toxicity. New\nYork is unique in that the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation has developed a\ncontaminated-sediment screening technical guidance document (NYSDEC 1999). This\ndocument developed sediment criteria based on the EPA equilibrium partitioning (EP)\nmodel. The role of EP-based sediment criteria is for screening potentially contaminated\nsediments, providing an initial assessment of possible adverse impacts.\nEP-based sediment criteria are tied to water quality standards and guidance values.\nTherefore, within the framework of New York State water quality regulations, sediment\ncriteria were derived according to the primary levels of protection for available Class SD\nwater quality standards or guidance values presented in Division of Water (1998).\nApplication of EP-based sediment criteria derivation is only suitable for non-polar organic\ncompounds, since derivation incorporates partitioning coefficient and organic carbon\nnormalization methodology. Because these criteria are normalized to sediment total organic\ncarbon (TOC), EP-based criteria can be thought of as site-specific sediment criteria (SSSC).\nSSSC were derived using available Class SD water quality standards or guidance values.\nThe same chemical-specific Class SD values used in our water quality analyses were\nmultiplied by respective chemical octanol/water partitioning coefficients and an organic\ncarbon conversion factor to derive a TOC-normalized sediment criterion for each transect.\nIdentification of octanol/water partitioning coefficients (K ) was performed for each non-\no/w\npolar organic compound using reference values primarily found in Schwarzenbach et al.\n(2003) and the NYSDEC Technical Guidance Document (1999).\nAfter applying the SSSC methodology we noticed unreasonably high Toxicity Quotients\n(TQs) associated with chlordane, aldrin, and dieldrin results. For example the TQs for\ndieldrin ranged from 2,227 to 298,687. These unreasonably high results might be an artifact\nof low Class SD water quality standards that were used to derive the SSSC. Fortunately, the\nNYSDEC Technical Guidance Document provided EPA ambient water quality criteria\nderived default sediment criteria for these three pesticides. The default sediment standard for\nchlordane (0.05 µg/gOC) was for acute toxicity protection of benthic aquatic life. The\naldrin/dieldrin default (0.1 µg/gOC) was for protection human health bioaccumulation.\nThese values were used in place of the K derived SSSC to derive TQs for these\no/w\ncontaminants. Application of these sediment standards did not change the number of transect\nresults that were over the criteria, but only changed the magnitude of respective TQs. These\ncriteria derived default TQs were integrated into the TQ datasets used in subsequent\nstatistical analyses. For a complete list and derivations steps of SSSC please refer to the\naccompanying tables in this Appendix.\nDerivation of Water Quality Thresholds\nClass SD water quality standards or guidance values served as toxicity benchmarks for the\nwater quality data and were used to predict potential ecological harm when compared to\nA-10\nmeasured contaminant values. New York State defines water quality standards with respect\nto classification of surface waters. Gowanus Canal is classified as Class SD saline surface\nwater; therefore, canal waters should be suitable for fish survival or “no acute toxicity.” It is\nimportant to note that generally Class SD waters are not intended to protect for more\nsensitive chronic toxicity endpoints such as fish propagation. For water quality screening\npurposes, 15 Class SD standards, 10 guidance values, and four narrative standards were\ncompared to transect condensed measured water column analyte concentrations (Table A-3).\nFrom these comparisons the frequency and magnitude, measured as TQs, of exceedances\nwere developed as above.\nTable A-3: Class SD standards, guidance values, and narrative standards used to derive\npercent exceedance and Toxicity Quotients.\nClass SD\nWQ\nClass SD WQ Narrative Class\nContaminant Guidance Comments\nStandards (µg/L) SD WQ Standards\nValues\n(µg/L)\nGuidance value used\nover standard due\nBenzene 10 a 670 b\npreference for fish\nsurvival endpoint\nGuidance value used\nover standard due\nToluene 6000 a 430 b\npreference for fish\nsurvival endpoint\nEthylbenzene 41 b\nXylene 170 b\nAcenaphthene 60 b\nFluorene 23 b\n2-Methylnaphthalene 38 b\nNaphthalene 140 b\nPhenanthrene 14 b\nBenzo[a]pyrene 0.0006 a\nAldrin 0.001 a\nAlpha-\nBenzenehexachloride 0.002 a\n(BHC)\nBeta-BHC 0.007 a\nDelta – BHC 0.008 a\nEpsilon – BHC 0.008 a\nGamma-BHC 0.008 a\nAlpha-Chlordane 0.00002 a\nTrans-Chlordane 0.00002 a\nDDT, DDE, DDD (sum) 0.000011 e\nDieldrin 0.0000006 a\nEndosulfan 0.034 b\nEndrin 0.002 a\nHeptachlor 0.0002 a\nHeptachlor epoxide 0.0003 a\nA-11\nClass SD\nWQ\nClass SD WQ Narrative Class\nContaminant Guidance Comments\nStandards (µg/L) SD WQ Standards\nValues\n(µg/L)\nToxaphene 0.07 b\nPCBs total 0.00012 e\nCopper 7.9 b\nLead 204 b\nMercury 0.0026 d\nNickel 74 b\nZinc 95 b\nShall not be less\nDissolved Oxygen (D.O.) than 3.0 mg/L at any\ntime.\nNone in amounts\nthat will adversely\naffect the taste, color\nOdor\nor odor thereof, or\nimpair the waters for\ntheir best usages.\nNone in amounts\nthat will adversely\naffect the taste, color\nClarity\nor odor thereof, or\nimpair the waters for\ntheir best usages.\nNo residue\nattributable to\nsewage, industrial\nFloatables wastes or other\nwastes, nor visible oil\nfilm nor globules of\ngrease\na = Human consumption of fish (saline waters)\nb = Fish survival (saline waters)\nc = Fish propagation (saline waters)\nd = Aesthetic (saline waters)\ne = Wildlife protection (saline waters)\nWater quality standards for the state’s waters are compiled in the Division of Water\nTechnical and Operational Guidance Series 1.1.1 (Division of Water, 1998). This document\nprovides ambient water quality standards and guidance values for toxic and non-conventional\npollutants derived under the authority of Article 17 of the Environmental Conservation Law\nand 6 NYCRR Parts 700-706, Water Quality Regulations. A standard value is a numeric\nconcentration value that has been promulgated and placed into regulation. A guidance value\nmay be used where a standard for a substance or a group of substances has not been\nestablished. Standards and guidance values are the maximum allowable concentration for a\ndefined water classification.\nFor Class SD waters, standards and guidance values are presented for protection of human\nconsumption of fish, fish survival, wildlife protection, and aesthetics. If more than one\nprotection categories are listed for a particular contaminant then the most stringent limitation\nA-12\nshould be applied. We compared transect condensed water quality results to available\nstandards or guidance values to develop transect specific TQs for each contaminant.\nThe NYSDEC also provides narrative water quality standards for Class SD waters outlined in\n6 NYCRR §703.2 Narrative water quality standards. Additionally water quality standards for\ndissolved oxygen (D.O.), odor, color and floatables, are provided in 6 NYCRR §703.3. The\nappropriate narrative standard for oil and floating substances states that “No residue\nattributable to sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes, nor visible oil film nor globules of\ngrease.” The Class SD standards for D.O. “Shall not be less than 3.0 mg/L at any time.”\nObservational accounts of sampling locations and conditions were used to screen narrative\nwater quality standards. The averaged transect specific D.O. results were used to determine\nrespective standard adherence. Because of the narrative nature of these additional water\nquality standards TQs could only be derived for D.O. Exceedance rates were developed for\neach narrative standards.\nReferences\nAquaSurvey, Inc. November 2005.

DECISION\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nBROOKLYN, KINGS COUNTY, NEW YORK\nINTRODUCTION\nThis Responsiveness Summary provides a summary of citizens' comments and\nconcerns received during the public comment period related to the Gowanus Canal\nSuperfund site (Site) Proposed Plan and provides the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency's (EPA's) responses to those comments and concerns. All comments\nsummarized in this document have been considered in the EPA’s final decision in the\nselection of a remedy to address the contamination at the Site.\nSUMMARY OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS ACTIVITIES\nDue to the technically complex issues at the Site and the significant public interest, the\nEPA greatly augmented its interaction with the community beyond what is typical for the\nSuperfund remedy selection process. Specifically, while the EPA typically releases\nRI/FS reports simultaneously with the Proposed Plan and conducts a public meeting to\ndiscuss the results of the investigation and the basis for the preferred remedy, for this\nSite, the RI and FS reports were released separately at the time of their respective\ncompletion in order to facilitate their review and understanding by the public. The RI\nreport was made available on the EPA’s website in January 2011 and the FS report was\nmade available on the EPA’s website in December 2011. Following the release of each\nof these documents, the EPA held separate public meetings in the Carroll Gardens and\nRed Hook neighborhoods to present the findings. These meetings were announced in\nthe local press. Several follow up meetings to further discuss the technical issues and\nthe community’s concerns were held at the invitation of the Gowanus Canal Community\nAdvisory (CAG) (which is composed primarily of local community group representatives\nwhose role in part is to disseminate information to their groups), the local Community\nBoards and other local organizations.\nOn December 27, 2012, a press release was issued (which generated a number of on-\nline articles) and a number of e-mails were sent to the Site’s mailing list re-announcing\nthe availability of the RI and FS reports and announcing the availability of an FS\naddendum report and Proposed Plan1 on the EPA’s website. On December 28, 2012,\nthe RI report, FS report, FS addendum report and Proposed Plan were made available\nto the public at information repositories maintained at the Community Free Library,\nlocated at the Carroll Gardens Library, the Joseph Miccio Community Center and the\n1 A Proposed Plan describes the remedial alternatives considered for a site and identifies the\npreferred remedy with the rationale for this preference.\nV-1\nEPA Region II Office. A notice of availability for the above-referenced documents was\npublished in the Courier Life, Red Hook Star-Revue and The Brooklyn Paper on\nJanuary 4, 2013. Notices were published in these papers again on January 18, 2013 to\nannounce a revised starting time for the January 23, 2013 public meeting. On January\n23, 2013 and January 24, 2013, the EPA conducted public meetings at Public School\n58 (the Carroll School) and the Joseph Miccio Community Center, respectively, to\npresent the Proposed Plan for the Site, including the preferred remedy, and to respond\nto questions and comments from the approximately 200 attendees at the January 23,\n2012 meeting and 100 attendees at the January 24, 2012 meeting. At both of the\nmeetings, there was nearly unanimous, strong support for the proposed remedy. At the\nJanuary 24, 2013 meeting, concerns were expressed by the public about an option\nproposed by EPA for the disposal in an on-Site confined disposal facility (CDF)2 for the\nstabilized, lesser contaminated sediments.\nPrior to the release of the Proposed Plan and the commencement of the public\ncomment period, a member of the CAG expressed concern that a 30-day comment\nperiod would be too short to provide the CAG members and other stakeholders\nsufficient time to provide technically well-informed comments. Accordingly, a 90-day\npublic comment period was announced at the time of the release of the Proposed Plan.\nIn response to a January 28, 2013 request from a representative of New York City\n(NYC) that the public comment period be extended 30 days, the comment period was\nextended to April 27, 2013.\nA notice announcing the extension of the public comment period to April 27, 2013 was\npublished in the Courier Life, Red Hook Star-Revue and The Brooklyn Paper on March\n22, 2013.\nDuring the comment period, the EPA held informational meetings with the CAG in\nCarroll Gardens on February 11, 2013, the Red Hook community on February 13, 2013,\nthe residents of public housing located immediately north of the canal on March 27,\n2013, the Red Hook community on April 16, 2013, the CAG on April 23, 2013 and the\nresidents of public housing in Red Hook on April 25, 2013 to discuss, in more detail, the\nspecifics of the Proposed Plan and to answer additional questions from the community.\nWith the exception of the April 25, 2013 meeting which was attended by 25 people, all\nof the other follow up meetings were well attended.\nSUMMARY OF COMMENTS AND RESPONSES\nComments were received at the two public meetings and in writing (letters, postcards\nand e-mail).\n2 A secure structure designed to contain dredged sediments (in this case, after stabilization)\nwithin a waterway.\nV-2\nThe public generally supports the dredging, capping and combined sewer overflow\n(CSO)3 contaminated solids abatement components of the remedy. The CAG, which is\ncomprised of approximately 50 members representing over 30 organizations and 20\nnon-organizational members, passed resolutions in support of the overall remedy,\nincluding 100% CSO control. Community Board Six, a municipal entity which\nrepresents the neighborhoods surrounding the canal, submitted comments supporting\nthe overall remedy.\nWhile 15 businesses and approximately 700 Red Hook residents located in close\nproximity to the proposed location of the CDF expressed support for its construction,\napproximately 900 parties located in other sections of Red Hook, elsewhere in New\nYork State and in other states expressed strong opposition to the CDF option. In\naddition, No Toxic Red Hook submitted two similar petitions to the EPA containing\napproximately 2,500 original names and signatures from business owners, residents,\nusers of the recreation area and concerned citizens. The petitions express opposition\nto the processing of contaminated sediments in Red Hook and their placement in a local\nCDF. The petitions can be found in Appendix V-f.\nAlthough various development interests filed formal comments in opposition to\nnomination of the Site for the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2009, no comments were\nfiled in opposition to the Proposed Plan by the developers who have acquired property\nalong the canal for residential, commercial and other redevelopment purposes since the\nSite was placed on the NPL.\nFriends of Douglass Greene Park presented the EPA with a petition with 765 parties\nexpressing opposition to the placement of an in-line sewage/stormwater retention tank\nbeneath the Douglass and Degraw community pool. The petition also sought an\nassurance from the EPA that should any disruption or displacement to the pool be\nnecessary as a result of the remediation, the park’s facilities and services would be\nprovided at a nearby location.\nThe NYC Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), a potentially responsible\nparty (PRP), submitted 124 pages of comments, with approximately 300 pages of\nattachments. When read in their entity, NYCDEP’s comments state that the CSOs do\nnot contribute to unacceptable impacts to the canal, lengthy additional studies are\nneeded prior to remedy selection, further nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)4 controls\nare needed and various project complexities effectively prevent addressing the\ncontamination in the canal. National Grid, another PRP, submitted 43 pages of\ncomments and 600 pages of attachments. National Grid, in sum, agreed that a\ncleanup of the canal can be done, despite significant technical challenges, asserted\nthat even greater CSO controls were warranted and advocated for less dredging than\n3 Combined sewers receive both sewage and stormwater flows and discharge to the canal when\nthe sewer system’s capacity is exceeded.\n4 Concentrated liquid contamination, typically oil-like, that forms a separate phase and does not\ndissolve in water.\nV-3\nindicated in the proposed plan. Comments questioning various aspects of the remedy\nwere also submitted by various other PRPs and industry-related parties. Notably,\nNYCDEP was alone in stating that no further CSOs controls are warranted. Industry\nand other PRP commenters suggested that additional CSO controls beyond those set\nforth in the Proposed Plan are needed for an effective cleanup.\nThe transcripts from the two public meetings can be found in Appendix V-d.\nThe written comments (letters, postcards and e-mails) submitted during the public\ncomment period can be found in Appendix V-e. A summary of the comments provided\nat the public meetings and in writing, as well as the EPA’s responses to them, are\nprovided below.\nHistorical Discharges\nComment #1: A commenter stated that, in the future, it would be better for the EPA to\nbe proactive in preventing the need for hazardous waste site cleanups.\nResponse #1: Following the canal’s construction in the mid-1800s, sewage and\nindustrial wastes were discharged directly into the canal, consistent with the poor\nenvironmental practices typical of the era. As a result of these discharges, the canal\nquickly became and has remained as one of New York's most polluted waterways.\nFollowing the creation of the EPA in 1970, Congress passed a number of laws with the\nintention of improving the environment. The Clean Water Act (CWA), passed in 1972,\nwas established with the goal of eliminating releases of high amounts of toxic\nsubstances into surface water. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)\nwas passed in 1976 to address the nation’s increasing problems from municipal and\nindustrial waste. The purpose of RCRA is to ensure proper management of hazardous\nwastes from the point of generation until final disposal. The CWA and RCRA have\nresulted in significant improvements in the handling of hazardous substances, greatly\nreducing the creation of new hazardous waste sites.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\n(CERCLA), more commonly known as “Superfund,” was created in 1980, primarily to\naddress the releases that occurred in the past. With the selected remedy for the Site,\nthe EPA intends to comprehensively address the various ongoing sources which\ncontinue to contribute contamination to the canal, including three former manufactured\ngas plants (MGPs) and ongoing discharges of contaminated CSO solids.\nPotentially Responsible Parties\nComment #2: A commenter stated that many businesses that made large profits over\nthe years polluted the canal and the upland areas. The commenter, as well as several\nother commenters, opined that those that are responsible for the contamination should\nbe held accountable for it.\nV-4\nResponse #2: Under state and federal Superfund laws, the parties that are responsible\nfor creating hazardous waste sites are responsible for addressing the contamination,\neither by performing the necessary investigatory and remediation work themselves or by\nproviding funds so that the State or the EPA can perform the work.\nThe former MGP facilities are being addressed under the State Superfund and\nBrownfield Cleanup programs by National Grid, a PRP for these facilities (as well as the\nSite).\nThe EPA has identified a number of PRPs related to the canal, with the primary ones\nbeing NYC and National Grid. In April 2010, the EPA entered into administrative\nconsent orders (AOCs)5 with NYC and National Grid to perform work in support of the\nEPA's remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) for the canal. Following the\nselection of a remedy for the Site, it is the EPA’s intention to use its enforcement\nauthorities to compel the PRPs to undertake the performance of the design and\nconstruction of the remedy at their own expense.\nSediment Transport and Deposition – Current Conditions in Canal\nComment #3: The PRP Group6 provided comments related to sediment transport and\ndeposition in the canal under current conditions. The general topics covered by these\ncomments are summarized below.\n The Proposed Plan does not discuss how the pattern/deposition rate of sediment\nmay have changed since 1850 and the factors responsible; understanding these\nfactors is crucial to the selection of the remedy and source control\ndesign/methodologies.\n The Proposed Plan does not explain why the upper canal is the reach most affected\nby deposition of CSO solids, or why the lower reach is not similarly impacted, and\nappears to contain internal inconsistencies related to the description of sediment\ntransport and deposition processes.\nResponse #3: Sediment deposition rates and patterns in the canal have varied since\n1850 due to the use of the canal as an open sewer, construction and operation of the\nFlushing Tunnel, watershed development, episodic dredging events, vessel\n5 AOCs are legal documents that formalize an agreement between the EPA and PRPs covering\nthe PRPs’ responsibilities to perform investigatory work at a Superfund site.\n6 The PRP Group consists of Beam, Inc.; The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation; ExxonMobil Oil\nCorporation; Hauck Manufacturing Company; Hess Corporation; Honeywell International, Inc.;\nMRC Holdings, Inc., for itself and on behalf of Citigroup, Inc.; Patterson Fuel Oil Company,\nInc.; Ream Beverage Can Company; SPX Corporation as successor to O-Z/Gedney Co., Inc.;\nUnion Oil Company of California and Verizon New York Inc.\nV-5\nmovements, changes in the sewer system configuration and other factors. Given the\ncomplexity of the canal’s history, any attempt to characterize historic patterns and rates\nof sediment deposition would be largely speculative. This historic information is not\nneeded to select and design the remedy for the canal. The remedy’s design must be\nbased on expected future conditions. Therefore, the EPA does not plan to further\ninvestigate historic sediment deposition rates and patterns.\nThe lack of tidal flow to the upper reach of the canal was anticipated even before the\ncanal was constructed. The general history of the flow problems created by the canal’s\nconfiguration and sewage inputs, including the accumulation of CSO sediment in the\nupper reach, has been documented in multiple reports by NYCDEP (1983 201 Facilities\nPlan, 1993 Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project, 2001 Gowanus Facilities\nUpgrade Plan, 2007 Receiving Water Quality Modeling Report, 2008 Gowanus Canal\nWaterbody/Watershed Facility Plan Report (WWFP)). NYC is also currently under order\nfrom the State to dredge the accumulated CSO sediment mound in the upper reach--\nwork that was first proposed and approved in 1983.\nThe “CSO Impacts” section of the FS report addendum explains why the upper reach of\nthe canal is most affected by the deposition of CSO solids: (1) the outfall at the head of\ncanal (RH-034) has the single largest contribution to annual CSO discharge; (2) the\nshallow sediments (0-2 feet depth interval) in the upper reach are less influenced by\nimpacts from the former MGP facilities or historical industrial discharges and (3) the\nsediments in the upper reach are less susceptible to resuspension by propeller wash\nfrom vessel traffic or from tidal forces. While the middle and lower reaches of the canal\nare impacted by CSO solids, the middle reach is also heavily impacted by the two\nformer MGP facilities located there and the lower reach is influenced by incoming\nsediment from Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay. When sediments are\nresuspended in the middle reach of the canal by vessel activity, the coarser-grained\nfraction redeposits first and the finer-grained fraction remains in suspension for a longer\nperiod of time. The portion of the finer-grained fraction that is transported to the lower\nreach by tidal advection-dispersion mixes with relatively clean incoming suspended\nsediments from Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay, resulting in an overall\ndecrease in contaminant concentrations.\nFinally, the approach utilized in the selected remedy also reduces the relevance of\nhistoric sediment deposition rate and patterns. Full removal of the accumulated\nsediment eliminates this as a post-construction source of sediment transport. CSO\nsolids control measures, combined with the work currently being implemented by the\nNYCDEP will significantly reduce CSO solids inputs.\nV-6\nReference Areas\nComment #4: National Grid and NYCDEP commented regarding the selection of the\nreference area for the canal RI/FS and the use of Gowanus Bay and Upper New York\nBay reference area data to predict post-remedy conditions within the canal as follows:\n National Grid noted that if NYCDEP cannot reach full CSO control because it is\ntechnically infeasible or prohibitively costly (or both), then any ongoing contribution\nshould be considered background for the canal.\n National Grid noted that the Proposed Plan does not fully acknowledge that the post-\nremedy environment of the canal will continue to receive stormwater and CSO\ndischarges from heavily urbanized and industrialized properties; there is no basis for\nconcluding that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in post-\nremedy surface sediments would be near the upper end of the Gowanus Bay and\nUpper New York Bay reference range (14 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]).\n NYCDEP noted that the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference locations\nare open water areas that are not as protected as the canal, and sediments that\naccumulate in the reference area are likely to be different from those that\naccumulate in the canal.\n NYCDEP noted that the EPA should consider the reference area data collected for\nthe Newtown Creek RI/FS. These reference area data were collected from 14 water\nbodies that were categorized as industrial with CSO input, industrial with minimal or\nno CSO input, non-industrial with CSO input and non-industrial with minimal or no\nCSO input.\nResponse #4: The sediment remedy will result in a clean cap surface on the bottom of\nthe canal. If the PAH contributions from the former MGP facilities and CSOs were\ncompletely eliminated, then the solids-associated PAHs deposited on this clean surface\nwould be derived primarily from solids delivered to the canal from Upper New York Bay\nthrough tidal action and the Flushing Tunnel, storm sewers and direct overland flow.\nThe suspended sediments from Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay would be\nexpected to have a substantial post-source control influence on sediment quality\nbecause less than 10 percent of the canal watershed is drained into the canal by storm\nsewers and direct runoff (assuming that no high-level sewer separation would occur)\nHowever, since CSOs to the canal will not be entirely eliminated as part of the sediment\nremedy, the newly-established background level of PAHs in surface sediment will\ndepend on the level of CSO reductions achieved. The goal is to reduce the contribution\nof CSO solids so that the average total PAH concentration in canal’s surface sediments\nafter remediation does not exceed the preliminary remediation goal (PRG)7 of 20 mg/kg.\n7 Because there are no promulgated standards or criteria that apply to the cleanup of\ncontaminated sediments in New York, Site-specific, PRGs for sediments in the Gowanus\nCanal were developed. PRGs are used to define the extent of cleanup needed to achieve the\nRAOs. A “clean” surface will be established at the bottom of the Gowanus Canal at the end of\nremedy construction. The PRGs will be used as performance targets for this “clean” surface.\nV-7\nIn other words, the remedy will be designed to achieve a total PAH background\nconcentration of less than 20 mg/kg total PAH.\nData recently collected from candidate reference areas for the Newtown Creek\nSuperfund site RI indicate that the range of PAH concentrations in enclosed and semi-\nenclosed industrial embayments without CSOs is comparable to the reference area\nconcentrations measured in the Gowanus Canal RI. Specifically, surface sediment\nsamples were collected from 14 enclosed or semi-enclosed water bodies generally\nlocated throughout Jamaica Bay and the Upper East River. The 14 areas were selected\nto represent four general categories of reference areas: (1) industrial with CSOs; (2)\nindustrial with no or minimal CSO input; (3) non-industrial with CSOs and (4) non-\nindustrial with no or minimal CSO input (Anchor QEA, 2012). Although with respect to\nthe Newtown Creek Superfund site RI, the data are still under evaluation and specific\nlocations for background and reference have not been determined, the data from the\ncandidate reference areas collectively provide an indication of the PAH concentrations\nthat can reasonably be expected in various types of water bodies. The Gowanus Canal\nwatershed includes a mix of residential, commercial and light industrial land uses, and\nmay fall between the industrial and non-industrial categories. Figure 1below, shows the\nmean total PAH concentration in each type of reference area, along with the 95 percent\nconfidence interval for the mean (the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference\narea (denominated as “GC Ref” in Figure 1) is also shown for comparison). For all\ncategories except “industrial with CSOs,” the mean and 95 percent confidence interval\nfor the mean total PAH background concentrations are near or below 20 mg/kg.8\n8 PAH data for the Newtown Creek reference areas were not evaluated on a carbon-normalized\nbasis because the PRG for the canal should be compared to the PAH concentrations in\nsediment at the point of exposure (in the canal), and reference area PAH concentrations are\nonly moderately correlated with Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content (R = 0.57).\nV-8\nReference Areas - Total PAH17\n40\n30\n)\ng\nk\n/\ng\nm\n20\n(\n7\n1\nH\nA\nP\n10\nal\nt\no\nT\n0\nInd.

As reported\nin the CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum, the estimated total PAH\nconcentrations on suspended sediments in the surface water samples from the\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference area are similar to the reference\narea surface sediment concentrations. Figure 1 indicates that the mean PAH\nconcentration in the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference area is similar to\nthe “non-industrial with no or minimal CSO input” category for the Newtown Creek\nreference area.\nThe newly-established background condition in the canal after the remedy\nimplementation is expected to have an average total PAH concentration of 20 mg/kg.\nThat is higher than the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference, but within the\nrange of background concentrations for a New York Harbor setting with characteristics\nsimilar to the Gowanus Canal.\nV-9\nPCB Concentrations in Surface Sediment from Canal and Reference Area\nComment #5: Consolidated Edison (ConEd), a PRP, stated that there is no statistically\nsignificant difference between total PCB congener concentrations in surface sediment\nsamples from the canal and samples from the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay\nreference area.\nResponse #5: The EPA did not perform statistical comparisons of total PCB congener\nconcentrations because fewer than ten sampling results were available for the reference\narea samples. Specifically, only three reference area samples were analyzed for PCB\ncongeners, which is an insufficient number for a robust statistical comparison. The\nstatistical comparison of total PCB Aroclor results (27 canal and 10 reference area\nsamples) indicated that the median concentration in the canal samples is significantly\nhigher than in the reference samples. However, as noted in the Proposed Plan, PCB\ncongener data are more reliable for the quantification of PCBs in sediments.\nThe plot in Figure 2, below, shows the distribution of total PCB congener concentrations\nin surface sediment samples collected by the EPA in 2010 for the RI. Also shown are\nthe total PCB congener concentrations in samples collected by NYCDEP at a subset of\nthe RI locations in 2013 (including five of the reference area locations). The EPA and\nNYCDEP results are consistent, and both show that the mean total PCB congener\nconcentration in canal sediments is above the 95 percent confidence interval of the\nmean reference area concentration. Total PCB congener concentrations of greater than\n4 mg/kg were detected in some of the canal surface sediments. Additionally, PCB\nAroclor data for deeper soft sediment9 show concentrations as high as 51 mg/kg (EPA,\n2010 RI samples) and 66 mg/kg (National Grid, 2012 CSO mound samples10). These\nresults clearly show that some of the surface and deeper soft sediments in the canal are\ncontaminated with PCBs at levels that are substantially higher than reference area\nconcentrations. PCBs in deeper soft sediments may be transported by various events,\nincluding vessel scour and storm events.\n9 “Soft sediment” is defined as the hazardous substance-contaminated sediments which have\naccumulated above the native sediments.\n10 These results were provided in National Grid’s comments on the Proposed Plan .\nV-10\nTotal PCB Congeners in Surface Sediment\n16\n14\n)\ng 12\nk\ng/\nm\n10\n(\ns\nr\ne\nn 8\ne\ng\nn\no 6\nc\nB\nC\n4\nP\nal\not\n2\nT\n0\n-2\nEPA Canal EPA Reference NYC Canal NYC Reference\n2010 2010 2013 2013\nNotes: NYC results are based on unvalidated data.

Although striped bass and white\nperch were caught in the canal, none were caught in the reference area, so direct\ncomparisons were not possible. The average concentration of total PCB congeners in\nthe eel fillet samples from the canal (six samples) was 862 micrograms per kilogram\n(µg/kg) wet weight, which is 1.8 times higher than the concentration in the single\nAmerican eel fillet sample from the reference area (475 µg/kg wet weight). The average\ntotal PCB congener concentration in whole body blue crab from the canal (12 samples)\nwas 157 µg/kg, which is 1.7 times higher than the average concentration in the\nreference area samples (91 µg/kg; eight samples).\nV-11\nThe concerted fish and shellfish collection effort undertaken for the RI did not yield\nsufficient numbers of samples of the same large fish species from both the canal and\nreference area to perform robust statistical comparisons. The plots in Figures 3 and 4,\nbelow, show the total PCB congener concentrations in all large fish fillets and whole\nbody blue crab samples for the canal and reference area. Although the results for the\nlarge fish fillets reflect a different mix of species in the canal and reference area, the\ndata collected to date indicate that PCB concentrations in large fish and crab tissue are\nhigher in the canal than in the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference area.\nIt should be noted that pre-existing New York State fishing advisories apply to both the\ncanal and the harbor. Despite these advisories, there is evidence of fish consumption\nwithin the canal and near the mouth of the canal, particularly for subsistence fishing\nwithin communities with environmental justice (EJ) concerns. PCBs in both the canal\nand the harbor are a source to fish and crab tissue. The PCBs in the canal are co-\nlocated with other COCs in the accumulated sediment. As a result, all of the PCB mass\nin the canal will be removed as part of the selected remedy. This removal is expected\nto lead to the elimination of PCBs available for fish and crab uptake within the canal.\nGiven that the unacceptable human health exposure pathway for fish ingestion is\ncaused solely by PCBs, addressing this exposure risk through removal of the\naccumulated sediments is warranted. Such removal will also reduce PCB transport to\nthe harbor and is expected to improve the background risk from ingestion of PCB-\ncontaminated fish.\nLarge Fish Fillets\n1600\n)\nht 1400\ng\nei\nw\net\n1200\nw\ng 1000\nk\ng/\n\n( 800\ns\nr\ne\nn\ne 600\ng\nn\no\nC 400\nB\nC\nP 200\nal\not\nT 0\nCanal Reference\nLarge Fish Large Fish\nFillets Fillets\nNotes:\nGowanus Canal - 6 American eel, 5 smallmouth bass, 2 white perch\nReference Area - 1 American eel, 3 scup, 1 weakfish\nThe mean and 95 percent confidence intervals are shown for each sample group.\nFigure 3: Total PCB Congener Concentrations in All Large Fish Fillets Samples for Canal and\nReference Area\nV-12\nWhole Body Blue Crab\n220\n)\nht\n200\ng\nei\nw\net 180\nw\ng\nk 160\ng/\n\n(\nr s 140\ne\nn\ne\ng\nn 120\no\nC\nB\nC 100\nP\nal\not 80\nT\n60\nCanal Reference\nBlue Crab Blue Crab\nNotes:\nThe mean and 95 percent confidence intervals are shown for each sample group.\nFigure 4: Total PCB Congener Concentrations in Whole Body Blue Crab Samples for Canal and\nReference Area\nPCB Sources\nComment #7: NYCDEP asserts that there are sources of PCBs to the Gowanus Canal\nother than CSOs that have not been identified.\nResponse #7: The RI/FS did not identify specific sources of PCBs to canal sediments\nother than CSOs and historic discharges. The CSO samples collected for the RI were\nanalyzed for PCB Aroclors only, which were detected in one wet weather CSO water\nsample. CSO samples collected by NYCDEP in 2013 were analyzed for PCB\ncongeners; total PCB congener concentrations on CSO solids ranged from 0. 24 to 0.\n94 mg/kg. These levels may be indicative of the low levels of PCBs typically found in\nurban runoff. These concentrations are substantially lower than total PCB congener\nconcentrations in some of the surface sediment samples collected from the canal,\nparticularly samples collected from the middle reach where total PCB congener\nconcentrations are as high as 15 mg/kg. As noted previously, removal of all of the\naccumulated sediment as part of the selected remedy will address any PCB\ncontributions from within the canal. The area with the highest detected PCB\nconcentration was in sediments in the middle reach of the canal. Additional sampling\nwill be conducted during the remedial design to determine if there is an upland source at\nthis location which requires control. Upland sources referred to NYSDEC will also be\ninvestigated, as appropriate. The use of PCBs was phased out in the 1970’s. ConEd’s\n3rd Avenue Service Center, which has operated since 1925, is located in the middle\nsection of the canal, has been connected to the sewer system, handled PCBs for many\nV-13\nyears, and has been the subject of numerous violations and spill events involving PCBs\nand other materials. See ConEd’s November 16, 2009 Response to the EPA\nInformation Request. The facility has been subject to corrective actions. It is also\npossible that some PCBs may continue to be transported from residual source areas\n(such as underground electric utility vaults) to the canal through CSO discharges.\nBased on the EPA’s investigation of PRPs, the number of facilities believed to have\nhandled PCBs in the vicinity of the canal is limited. As a result of these factors, the EPA\nbelieves that the PCB loading in the canal is primarily from historic disposal.\nSource Characterization and Control\nComment #8: A commenter opined that the Proposed Plan is missing an integrated\nmapping of overall polluted upland areas and their impacts on the water and that the RI\nhas sidestepped the issue of an integrated flood plain-wide pollution assessment.\nNYCDEP, National Grid, the PRP Group, the Sediment Management Workgroup11 and\nCommunity Board Six note the importance of identifying, characterizing and effectively\ncontrolling all upland sources along the canal and coordinating these actions with the\nimplementation of the canal remedy to prevent recontamination of the canal and to\nensure the sustainability of the implemented remedy. The upland contaminant sources\nof concern identified by these commenters included:\n CSOs\n Former MGP facilities\n Other upland sites\n Surface runoff\n Unpermitted outfalls\n Direct loading of solids from eroding fill material along the shoreline through broken\nbulkheads\nThe general concerns that were expressed by the commenters include:\n NYCDEP, National Grid, the Sediment Management Workgroup, Community Board\nSix note that the Proposed Plan fails to adequately address the EPA’s long-standing\npriority to control sources early, thereby posing a significant risk of recontamination.\nThe priority should be controlling all contamination sources along the canal.\n The Sediment Management Workgroup and National Grid note that the Proposed\nPlan focuses on the sediments, rather than on potential sources of recontamination,\nsuch as CSOs, stormwater, groundwater and sediment resuspension due to\ncommercial navigation and the Flushing Tunnel.\n NYCDEP and National Grid note that the Proposed Plan does not identify all\npotential continuing sources of contamination to the canal. The EPA should identify\n11The Sediment Management WorkGroup is an ad hoc group open to membership from industry\nand government parties with responsibility for management of contaminated sediments. The\nwork group’s objective is to advance scientifically-sound approaches to improve sediment risk\nassessment, collect and share information to enhance and evaluate remedial technologies\nand alternatives and promote risk-based and cost-effective sediment management decisions.\nV-14\nand characterize these sources. The EPA should quantify the major sources of\nPAHs to the canal and evaluate their impacts under future conditions with respect to\nthe proposed remedy.\n NYCDEP and National Grid note that the Proposed Plan does not present details on\nthe remedial measures for controlling all sources of contamination to the canal, other\nthan the former MGPs.\n National Grid notes that a background level after all sources of contamination to the\ncanal are controlled should be established. After that, a control plan with specific\nsteps and schedules can be established. The plan should control sources to the\nmaximum achievable level, while it should simultaneously maintain flexibility and\nemploy an adaptive management approach to design the rest of the remedy.\n NYCDEP, National Grid and the PRP Group note that upland sources are not well\nunderstood and the interception/remediation of these sources are not defined in the\nProposed Plan. Historical operations along the canal include approximately 80\nparcels directly adjacent to the canal that may be responsible for groundwater\nimpacts.\n NYCDEP notes that the Proposed Plan does not recognize the critical importance of\ngroundwater on the long-term effectiveness of the sediment remedy and the need to\nintegrate groundwater management with in-canal remedies.\n NYCDEP notes that the Proposed Plan does not address the direct loading of solids\nfrom eroding fill material along the shoreline through broken bulkheads. Fill is\nknown to contain ash and other wastes that are high in PAHs, metals and other\ncontaminants.\n National Grid notes that hazardous wastes from accidental spills are conveyed to the\ncanal through CSOs, storm water and unpermitted outfalls. These spills and\ntransport routes must be recognized and addressed prior to any remedy selection.\n The Sediment Management Workgroup and National Grid note that the Proposed\nPlan does not adequately address the timing and sequencing of the sediment\nremedy and source control efforts.\n NYCDEP and National Grid note that the Proposed Plan does not offer tangible\nevidence of the EPA’s coordination with others related to the anticipated\nimplementation schedules for non-former MGP upland sites and CSO controls,\nrelative to the sediment remedy. Such cleanups must be conducted prior to\naddressing canal sediments, as they present potential for recontamination.\n National Grid notes that the effectiveness of upland source control measures must\nbe demonstrated prior to any remedy implementation.\n NYCDEP notes that the Proposed Plan should have described how the\neffectiveness of the reductions achieved as a result of source control will be\nmonitored during the post-remedial five-year reviews.\nThe overall response addresses the following comment topics because of their\ninterconnection:\nV-15\n Consistency of the EPA’s actions at the Gowanus Canal with the EPA’s priority for\nsource control\n Identification, characterization and remedial measures for all sources\n Timing and sequencing of sediment remedy in canal with source control efforts\n Coordination with other parties to implement the necessary source controls\n Monitoring and demonstrated effectiveness of source control measures\nResponse #8: The EPA recognizes the critical importance of identifying, characterizing\nand abating all continuing sources of contaminant releases to the canal and integrating\nthese actions with the schedule for the sediment remedy in the canal. The EPA\nrecognizes that controlling these releases is critical to ensuring the protectiveness and\nsustainability of the sediment remedy. To that end, the EPA included source control as\na baseline component of all remedial alternatives evaluated in the FS and, by extension,\nin the selected remedy.\nIn the RI/FS reports and Proposed Plan, the EPA identified multiple sources and\ntransport pathways for the release of contaminants to the canal. While all identified\nsources along the canal will be addressed, the EPA considers the primary ongoing\nsources of contamination to be the CSOs in the upper reach of the canal (outfalls\nRH-034 and OH-007) and the three former MGP facilities. The EPA is coordinating and\nwill continue to coordinate with NYSDEC, which is directing the investigation and\nremediation of contaminated upland areas adjacent to the canal with the goal of\ndeveloping and implementing remedies that will prevent recontamination of the canal.\nThe EPA has identified and has referred to NYSDEC a number of properties along the\ncanal, for NYSDEC investigation and, if necessary, remediation.\nThe EPA recognizes the importance of the timing of the implementation of the source\ncontrols relative to the implementation of the sediment remedy. To that end, the EPA\ndeveloped a schedule for the implementation of the canal remedy that integrates the\ntiming of the source controls at the former MGP facilities, CSOs and other sources\nidentified along the canal. The EPA and NYSDEC have discussed this schedule and its\nelements and the responsibilities of each party in relation to ensuring that the overall\nschedule for the canal is achieved. This schedule is available at for review at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/gowanus/pdf/EPADECDEPGowanusTimeline\n11-2011.pdf.\nEvidence of the cooperation and coordination between the EPA and NYSDEC is the\nrapid progress made at establishing the general scope and schedules for the source\ncontrol remedies at the three former MGP facilities, which likely present the most\ncomplex challenges from all the upland properties identified for investigation of\ncontaminant release potential. The source control remedies for the former MGP\nfacilities need to be consistent with the remedial objectives and schedule for the\nsediment remedy in the canal.\nAfter remedy implementation, as required under CERCLA, the EPA will be responsible\nfor monitoring to assess the effectiveness of the source control measures and thus, the\neffectiveness of the remedy.\nCombined Sewer Overflows\nV-16\nThe majority of the commenters agreed with the need to control CSO discharges and\nsuggested that higher levels of controls or capture of these discharges were needed\nthan estimated in the Proposed Plan. NYCDEP, however, commented that the CSOs\nare not contributing to the contamination present in the canal. Therefore, NYCDEP\nasserted that CSO controls are not needed for CERCLA remedial purposes.\nIn a letter dated June 28, 2012, NYSDEC identified eight possible options that might be\neffective in addressing solids from CSOs and suggested that NYCDEP evaluate the\nfeasibility of these options. NYCDEP completed its response (Evaluation of Possible\nMeasures for CSO Solids Control, Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, Brooklyn, New York,\nOctober 3, 2012) for the following eight options:\n Optimizing existing sedimentation trap at outfall OH-007\n Improved maintenance program at the outfall OH-007 sediment trap\n Installation of silt curtains and/or netting facilities at all CSO outfalls discharging to\nthe Gowanus Canal\n Yearly monitoring of CSO solids deposition in the canal\n Development of metrics for maintenance dredging of CSO solids in the canal\n Additional regular sewer cleaning in the drainage area\n Engineering evaluation of an interim or permanent sedimentation trap at outfall RH-\n034.\n Advance NYCDEP’s dredging of CSO mounds at the head end of the canal to\ncomply with the CSO Order on Consent, while seeking synergetic opportunities to\nadvance the demonstration and development of remedial design protocols for\ndredging, dewatering, disposal, stabilization and capping pursuant to the Superfund\nprogram.\nIn parallel, the EPA evaluated possible options identified by NYSDEC and added to\nthese options, the installation of CSO retention tanks.\nThe FS report addendum presented the degree of contaminated CSO solids reductions\nestimated to be required by the EPA to meet the established remedial action objectives\nfor the canal, the results of the CSO solids control measure screening performed by the\nEPA and costs for the different CSO solids control options. The EPA selected the\nretention tank option because tanks are the only technology able to achieve the\nprojected needed contaminated CSO solids reductions.\nFormer Manufactured Gas Facilities\nThe former MGP facilities are being characterized and addressed under the State\nSuperfund and Brownfield Cleanup programs by National Grid, a PRP for these sites as\nwell as for the canal.12 The EPA and NYSDEC have agreed to a coordinated schedule\n12 NYC, which is an owner of major source area parcels at the Public Place Brownfields site and\nthe former Fulton MGP State Superfund site, is also a PRP for these former MGP facilities.\nV-17\nfor the former MGPs and canal sediment cleanup efforts based on the anticipated timing\nof the dredging in the canal (which would commence at the head of the canal).\nIn January 2012, NYSDEC directed National Grid to begin the expedited remedial\ndesign of a cutoff wall as an interim remedial measure for the Fulton former MGP, near\nthe head of the canal. The purpose of this wall is to prevent subsurface migration of\nNAPL from the Fulton former MGP facility into the sediments at the bottom of the canal.\nFor the Carroll Gardens/Public Place (formerly known as “Citizens Gas Works”)\n(hereinafter, “Public Place”) former MGP facility, the remedy includes a combination of\nexcavation and a subsurface barrier wall and tar extraction wells. An investigation and\npartial source control cleanup was implemented at the Metropolitan site, the third and\nmost southerly former MGP facility, in 2003 under the State’s Voluntary Cleanup\nprogram. Since there are potential source areas at this former MGP facility that were\nnot addressed by the actions taken in 2003, an RI is currently underway. Based upon\nthe remedy selected for the Carroll Gardens/Public Place former MGP facility and the\ninterim remedial measure for the Fulton former MGP, it is presumed that the remedy for\nthe Metropolitan former MGP will include the construction of a cutoff wall between the\nformer MGP facility and the canal, removal of remaining major mobile coal tar sources,\nand recovery of coal tar product collected in the approach to the cut-off wall.\nThe control measures described above are expected to address releases from the three\nformer MGPs and provide the needed source control.\nOther Upland Properties\nThe Gowanus Canal RI included an evaluation of the potential for contaminated\ngroundwater to recontaminate canal sediments following implementation of the selected\nremedy. The EPA identified 16 locations that may represent potential ongoing sources\nof contamination to the canal via groundwater discharge. These sites were referred to\nNYSDEC for investigation and, if necessary, remediation under the State Superfund\nprogram.\nSome of the identified locations appear to be areas where MGP tar has been\ntransported outside the original source areas, deposited on the canal bottom and\nsubsequently infiltrated into the banks of the canal at certain locations. Depending on\nthe degree of contamination and the elevation of the contaminated soils, tar could move\nback toward the canal as dredging proceeds, presenting the potential for\nrecontamination of sediments. Subsurface barrier walls along the bank of the canal\nmay be required in these areas in order to protect the integrity of the canal remedy.\nRelative to the former MGP facilities, these areas are significantly smaller potential\nsources of contamination to the canal and are, thus, expected to require only a fraction\nof the time and cost to address. The costs of these smaller upland parcels have not\nbeen included in EPA’s decision document. The costs and remedy selection, to the\nextent required for these other parcels, will be determined in separate cleanup decisions\nfollowing their respective investigations. Based on the EPA’s ongoing interactions with\nNYSDEC, landowners, developers and PRPs, the EPA anticipates that the cleanups will\nbe funded and performed by a variety of parties. These include developers of projects\nV-18\nalong the canal (such as the Whole Foods and Lightstone Group), as well as current\nand former owners responsible for disposal.13 The EPA will coordinate with NYSDEC\nthe remediation schedules for these sites relative to the schedule for the canal remedy\nto ensure that they too do not compromise the effectiveness of the remedy.\nThe EPA proposes to address several of the identified locations as part of the remedy\nfor the canal--the filled-in former 1st Street Basin; 400 Carroll Street (part of the\nLightstone Group project) and a portion of the 5th Street Basin beneath the 3rd Avenue\nbridge.\nBecause the upland contamination source areas which may impact groundwater have\nbeen referred to NYSDEC for investigation and remediation, if necessary, the EPA\nbelieves that no additional components of a separate groundwater remedy are required\nas part of the overall remedy for the Gowanus Canal.\nWithin the canal boundaries, the proposed cleanup approach for the Gowanus Canal is\nconsistent with OSWER Directive 9283. 1-33, June 2009, Summary of Key Existing\nEPA CERCLA Policies for Groundwater Restoration, because it does not rely on dilution\nor dispersion of contaminated groundwater discharging into the canal. The criteria in\nthe OSWER Directive that “groundwater should not be allowed to migrate and further\ncontaminate the aquifer or other media” has been met by identifying the groundwater\ndischarges that should be addressed under the State Superfund program. Additionally,\nin-situ stabilization (ISS) and the active layer in the sediment cap will be designed to\nadsorb contaminants in upwelling groundwater prior to discharge to the canal.\nThe Region has completed additional studies to determine and manage, through\nstabilization and capping, the effects of contaminant leaching from native sediments to\nupwelling groundwater that discharges to the canal. These studies have used the\nrecently developed Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) that has\nidentified four new analytical methods to assess the leaching from native and stabilized\nmedia. A report on these studies has been recently issued and is part of the\nAdministrative Record for the site.\nSurface Water\nWhile surface water runoff was identified as a contaminant transport pathway in the\nconceptual site model (CSM) for the canal, it was identified as a relatively minor source\ncompared to other sources, because direct runoff drains only six percent of the\nwatershed surrounding the canal. The EPA’s assessment of this issue is consistent\nwith studies performed by NYCDEP:\n13 Several of the sites referred by the EPA to NYSDEC appear to be potentially related to the\nformer MGP facilities. NYSDEC is aware of the existence of parcels to which coal tar\ncontamination may have migrated from the original former MGP facility parcels, particularly\nnear Public Place. Parcels which further investigation shows are associated with the former\nMGP facility contamination will be addressed by National Grid, most likely as part of a second\ncleanup phase after the primary former MGP source areas have been addressed.\nV-19\nDirect overland runoff from undeveloped areas immediately adjacent to the\nwaterbody still occurs, but is insignificant in terms of magnitude and impact when\ncompared to combined sewer and stormwater discharges. Therefore nonpoint\nsource loads are not considered in the receiving water model. (NYCDEP\nReceiving Water Quality Modeling Report – Volume 4 – Gowanus Canal. City-\nWide Long Term CSO Control Planning Project – September 2007, page 3-3).\nNYC has a green infrastructure implementation plan for the coming years that it expects\nwill lead to an incremental reduction in runoff entering the combined sewers and reduce\nCSOs to the canal. An added objective for this green infrastructure plan should be\naiming to reduce the surface runoff that can discharge directly to the canal.\nUnpermitted Pipe Outfalls\nNearly 250 outfalls were identified and evaluated in the RI. Based on the RI data and\nmeasurements, the loadings from the unpermitted outfalls are insignificant by\ncomparison to other sources, such as the CSOs. The EPA’s assessment in this regard\nis consistent with NYCDEP’s 2008 WWFP:\nThe NYCDEP Shoreline Survey Program has identified numerous point source\ndischarges to Gowanus Canal. Approximately 144 outfalls were identified by the\nShoreline Survey, of which about 126 were not already addressed elsewhere in\nthis report as combined-sewer or storm sewer outfalls. . . .Overall, the total\ncontribution of flow from these additional point sources was determined to be\ninsignificant relative to CSO and stormwater inputs. The 154 MGD average\ninduced flow resulting from the Flushing Tunnel, as described elsewhere in this\nreport, further diminishes the significance of these inputs. (NYCDEP WWFP,\n2008, pages 4-35 and 4-39).\nNevertheless, the selected remedy includes measures to control discharges through the\nunpermitted outfalls to the canal. Unpermitted discharges will be terminated by either\nsealing the pipes or requiring the property owner to obtain the necessary permit to\ncontinue the discharge.\nDirect Loading of Solids from Eroding Fill Material along Shoreline through Broken\nBulkheads\nSolids contributed by erosion (including through bulkheads in disrepair) are of potential\nconcern to the remedy if the solids contribute hazardous substances. Cleanup of the\nupland parcels should reduce or eliminate such hazardous substance loadings via\nerosion. In addition, the EPA anticipates that the majority of the bulkheads along the\ncanal will be upgraded prior to or during the course of the remedial action, limiting the\ncontribution of fill material via erosion through bulkheads. Where replacement is not\nneeded for purposes of the remedy, the EPA will facilitate a streamlined permitting\napproach to reduce transaction costs and expedite approval.\nIn cases where bulkheads are so deteriorated that they may fail when the temporary\nsheet-piling is removed after dredging, the EPA intends to cooperate with NYC on\ninspection and enforcement of existing NYC bulkhead maintenance requirements.\nV-20\nOther Pipe Outfalls\nComment #9: National Grid provided comments related to the existence of unpermitted\npipe outfalls along the length of the canal. The comments focused on characterization\nof the potential discharges from the pipes and the significance of the discharges to the\nevaluation and design of a remedy. The specific comments included the following:\n The RI did not evaluate wet weather discharges from any of these pipes. As a\nresult, the chemical loading from these unpermitted discharges is unknown.\n Loading from the over 200 unpermitted pipes could be a significant factor in the\nevaluation of a Site remedy\n The EPA’s investigations of unpermitted pipes is more of a “snapshot” and does not\nprovide the entire story because they were not conducted concurrently with releases\nof contaminants from upland sources.\n There is no reference in the Proposed Plan as to where the data from the additional\nwork of “tracing outfall features to their origin” can be found.\nResponse #9: The selected remedy requires that the unpermitted discharges be\nterminated by either sealing the pipes or requiring the property owner to obtain the\nnecessary permit from New York State in order to continue the discharge. These\nmeasures will ensure that unpermitted discharges will not compromise the remedy’s\neffectiveness and sustainability. The EPA will work with NYSDEC and NYCDEP to\nidentify the property owners associated with unpermitted pipe outfalls and develop a\nplan to address the discharges.\nBased on independent evaluations, both the EPA and NYCDEP concluded that the\noverall loading from the unpermitted pipes is minor compared to CSO and stormwater\ninputs. As noted above, the WWFP states that \"Overall, the total contribution of flow\nfrom these additional point sources was determined to be insignificant relative to CSO\nand storm water inputs. The 154 [million gallons per day] average induced flow\nresulting from the Flushing Tunnel... further diminishes the significance of these inputs”\n(NYCDEP, 2008). Additional work to fully characterize and quantify the loadings from\nthese pipes is unwarranted, given that they will be sealed or permitted as part of the\nremedy. Additional details of the pipe outfall evaluation, including the work that was\nperformed to trace outfall features to their origin, are provided in the RI report, Appendix\nG: Survey of Outfall Features to the Canal.\nFormer Manufactured Gas Plant Facility Cleanups\nComment #10: A commenter asked whether there is a settlement agreement between\nNational Grid and the State of New York to carry out the design and construction of\nremedial work at the three former MGPs facilities located along the canal.\nResponse #10: National Grid is the primary PRP for the former MGP facilities. The\ninvestigation and cleanup of the former Fulton Municipal Works and Metropolitan MGP\nfacilities are being addressed by National Grid under an agreement with the State of\nNew York. That agreement also covers a number of other additional facilities formerly\nV-21\noperated by Brooklyn Union Gas. Public Place is being addressed in a similar manner\nby National Grid under the State’s Brownfield Cleanup programs. The design of the\nremedy that was selected for Public Place in 2007 is approximately 50% complete.\nComment #11: Because of the inability to remove all of the contaminants from the\nformer MGP facilities and a concern that unforeseen events, such as a hurricane, might\ncause a release of contaminants, a commenter suggested that it be mandated that the\nformer MGP properties be restricted to open space, parkland or restored wetlands\nrather than residential development.\nResponse #11: The intent of remediating the former MGP facilities is to prevent the\nmigration of contaminants into the canal, prevent exposure of the public and ecological\nreceptors to contamination and remove or immobilize as much of the contaminant\nsource material as practicable. This may be accomplished through a variety of\nmeasures, such as containment, treatment, removal and institutional controls. The\nextent of the remediation of the former MGP facilities will be a function of the intended\nfuture use of each property and the potential for the contamination to affect off-Site\nproperties, including the canal itself. If the intended future use of the former MGP\nfacilities is residential, the remedies will need to be consistent with restricted residential\ncleanup objectives.\nComment #12: A commenter noted that the NYC parks department needs to work with\nthe EPA, National Grid and NYSDEC to properly excavate the coal tar-contaminated\nsoils under the pool at the Thomas Greene Park (the park overlies the former Fulton\nMGP State Superfund site). Another commenter requested that the EPA demand the\nhighest level of remediation possible for the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site\nfrom National Grid. Several commenters suggested that the EPA use its Superfund\nauthority to enforce the entire upland area cleanup in a coordinated fashion that will not\ncause multiple disruptions to the community and its resources. Other commenters\nsuggested that the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site be incorporated into the\nSuperfund cleanup to ensure the protectiveness of the remedy.\nResponse #12: National Grid is undertaking the investigation and cleanup of the three\nformer MGP facilities under New York State supervision. While NYSDEC has not yet\ncompleted the remedy selection process for the former Fulton MGP State Superfund\nsite (it is anticipated that National Grid will complete an FS report this year), New York\nState regulations governing the State Superfund program require source removal or\ncontrol for all remedies, including former MGP facilities. NYSDEC will ensure that each\nremedy will adequately address the source of the contamination so as to prevent the\nmigration of contamination into the canal. The EPA and NYSDEC have agreed to a\ncoordinated cleanup schedule through which the agencies will seek to maximum\nefficiencies while minimizing construction impacts to the extent possible.\nComment #13: Bluestone Gowanus Green Partners indicated that its proposal for Public\nPlace will provide much needed affordable housing and public open space. The\ncommenter expressed concern about the timeliness of the completion of the remedy for\nV-22\nPublic Place former MGP facility. Bluestone Gowanus Green Partners also expressed\na desire to discuss with the EPA and NYSDEC the design for this facility. Specifically,\nthey would like to discuss excavation depths, barrier wall materials, the barrier wall and\nits final location and the location of tie backs for the barrier wall, location of collection\nwells and any other facility or access connected to the remediation which might\nultimately be located on the former MGP facility.\nResponse #13: The cleanup of Public Place will be completed in accordance with a\nschedule agreed upon between the EPA and NYSDEC to insure that releases from this\nfacility are controlled in a timely manner so as not to affect the integrity of the canal\nremedy as the canal remedy is implemented. That schedule is intended to provide a\ntimeframe by which upland source control work must be done. The design of the\nremedy is roughly 50 percent complete at this time. A large-scale pilot test is scheduled\nto begin in early fall 2013.\nNYC owns more than half of the property subject to the Public Place cleanup and also\nowns the Bond-Lorraine sewer beneath the property, which will need to be replaced as\npart of the cleanup. The sewer replacement will remove sewer flow obstructions which\nhave been present at this location for decades. In so doing, the project will help reduce\nthe frequency and volume of CSO events in this area of the canal. The locations for\nbarrier wall tiebacks are dictated largely by the need to protect the reconstructed sewer\nline.\nIt is well known that significant redevelopment is anticipated around the canal, including\nhigh density residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal that has already\nbeen approved. NYC fully supports the cleanup and redevelopment of this parcel and\nhas made it available to Bluestone Gowanus Green Partners. If redevelopment plans\nnecessitate the refinement of the remedial design, NYSDEC has indicated that it is\nwilling to discuss such modifications with NYC and the developer.\nIt should be noted that the EPA does not have a formal role with respect to land use\nzoning and related issued regarding upland properties along the canal. NYSDEC,\nwhich is overseeing National Grid’s work, and NYC, as owner of the property and\nthrough its zoning and building construction regulatory process, have the primary roles\nregarding cleanup schedules and design considerations.\nComment #14: A commenter expressed concern that failure to install the proposed\ncutoff wall as an interim remedial measure at the former Fulton MGP State Superfund\nsite to prevent further migration of NAPL into the canal in a timely manner would\nsignificantly delay the commencement of the cleanup of the canal. The commenter also\nstated that since the design and proposed location of the cutoff wall have yet to be\npresented to the public, not only is the coordination of the implementation of this remedy\nwith the overall cleanup of the canal in question, but understanding the impacts of\nwhere the NAPL could possibly migrate to if it is prevented from entering the canal\ncreate additional concerns about the health and safety of nearby residents, businesses\nand park and pool users. In addition, states the commenter, National Grid insists that\nV-23\ncoal tar waste only migrates downward, whereas the EPA has stated that NAPL can\nmigrate downward and upward and can be transported via groundwater.\nResponse #14: In January 2012, NYSDEC directed National Grid to begin an expedited\nremedial design of a cutoff wall as an interim remedial measure for the former Fulton\nMGP State Superfund site. The purpose of this wall is to prevent subsurface migration\nof NAPL from this former MGP facility into the sediments at the bottom of the canal.\nNAPL generally migrates laterally or laterally and downwards through soil, depending\non its specific gravity. Once in the canal, however, other processes, such as ebullition\nfrom gas bubbles, may cause small amounts of NAPL to rise. Regardless of the\ndirection NAPL migrates, it is anticipated that hydraulic controls will be necessary to\nprevent the migration of NAPL and contaminated groundwater around the cutoff wall.\nAccordingly, the design will include a NAPL collection system similar to the system\nincluded in the Public Place design to prevent the redirection of NAPL flow to\nsurrounding areas.\nComment #15: A commenter expressed concern about how the future elimination of the\nmigration of NAPL will be achieved, since remedies have not been selected for two of\nthe three former MGP facilities.\nResponse #15: While remedies have not been selected for the Fulton and Metropolitan\nformer MGP facilities, based upon the remedy that has been selected for the Public\nPlace former MGP facility, it is assumed that the remedies will include the removal of\nmobile sources, construction of cutoff walls along the canal and active recovery of\nNAPL near the cutoff walls for each of the former MGP facilities. These remedies,\nwhich are consistent with techniques used at other former MGP facilities in New York\nState, will prevent the migration of contamination from the former MGP facilities into the\ncanal. The cleanup of the former MGP facilities will be completed in accordance with\nschedules agreed upon between the EPA and NYSDEC to insure that releases from the\nformer MGP facilities are controlled in a timely enough manner so as not to affect the\nintegrity of the canal remedy.\nComment #16: A commenter asked how much the remediation of the three former MGP\nfacilities being undertaken by National Grid will cost.\nResponse #16: While NYSDEC has not yet completed the remedy selection process for\nthe Fulton and Metropolitan former MGP facilities, NYSDEC has selected a remedy for\nthe Public Place former MGP facility. Based on National Grid’s remedial design work\nperformed for the Public Place former MGP facility to date, the cost to address this\nfacility is estimated to be $175-200 million. It is assumed that the costs for the two other\nformer MGP facilities would each be in the same range or less.\nRemediation Plan\nComment #17: A commenter requested that the EPA stick with the remedy described in\nthe Proposed Plan and not let any of the components be negotiated away. Another\nV-24\ncommenter stated that the RI report had some data gaps with regard to the nature of\nlandfilling around the Gowanus Canal. The commenter provided some background\nmaterial suggesting that the 4th Street turning basin, which the Proposed Plan did not\naddress, be included in the remediation proposal. Several other commenters also\nsuggested that the 4th Street turning basin be addressed.\nResponse #17: While the essential components of the selected remedy (dredging,\ncapping and CSO abatement) are the same as the remedy proposed in the Proposed\nPlan, several modifications were made to portions of the selected remedy.\nThe Proposed Plan presented two disposal options for the lesser contaminated\nsediments dredged from the lower portion of the canal--off-Site stabilization and reuse\nor on-Site stabilization followed by their placement in a CDF located on privately-owned\nproperty at the Gowanus Bay Terminal (GBX) on Columbia Street in Red Hook---that\nwould be evaluated based upon community input and acceptance. The EPA’s intent\nwas to introduce the on-Site stabilization and CDF creation option and discuss its merits\nwith the community. If the community objected to it following the public presentations,\nthe option would not be selected.\nDuring the public comment period, significant concerns were expressed about the\noption of using on-Site stabilization of the lesser contaminated sediments dredged from\nthe lower portion of the canal and their placement in a CDF. As a result of the\ncommunity’s concerns, this disposal option was eliminated from consideration. These\nsediments will be stabilized off-Site and beneficially reused to the extent possible.\nIt should be noted that some confusion exists as to the names of the various turning\nbasins. The 4th Street turning basin connects with the filled in 5th Street turning basin at\nthe location of the 3rd Avenue Bridge. The selected dredging and capping remedy\nincludes the remediation of the 4th Street turning basin. Based upon suggestions made\nduring the public comment period, the remedy also includes the dredging, capping and\nrestoration of the portion of the 4th Street turning basin underneath the 3rd Avenue\nbridge, as well as the portion of the 5th Street turning basin beginning underneath the\n3rd Avenue bridge and extending approximately 25 feet to the east, and the installation\nof a barrier or interception system, as determined during remedial design, on the 5th\nStreet turning basin side of the bridge. This parcel was previously referred by the EPA\nto NYSDEC for investigation as an additional upland source area.\nDredging Complete Soft Sediment Column Negatively Impacts Dissolved Oxygen\nContent in Canal\nComment #18: NYCDEP and National Grid point out that the decreased velocity of\nsurface water through the canal resulting from a deeper channel depth as a result of\ndredging may result in a net decrease in the dissolved oxygen content of the canal.\nNYCDEP points out that it has invested $150 million retrofitting the Flushing Tunnel to\ndeliver higher flow rates to help maintain dissolved oxygen levels at standards set by\nthe State of New York and these efforts may be insufficient to meet the standards with\nV-25\nthe deeper channel. NYCDEP also states that the organic pollutants in the canal would\nundergo oxidation for a longer period of time, stressing dissolved oxygen\nconcentrations.\nResponse #18: While a deeper channel will slow the water flow rate in the canal\ncompared to a shallower channel and may decrease the dissolved oxygen\nconcentrations in portions of the canal, potential decreases in dissolved oxygen from a\ndeeper channel would likely be offset by the reduced load of organic matter in the canal\nas a result of CSO controls and the removal of the large organic load already present in\nthe existing soft sediment. The present conditions at the canal bottom generate a high\ndemand for oxygen which is consumed during reactions with the chemical and\nbiological contaminants. A clean canal bottom will result in a higher concentration of\navailable oxygen in the water.\nStudies performed by National Grid demonstrate that the CSOs are a source of the\ndissolved oxygen depletion in the canal. The remedy controls for CSOs will reduce the\ndischarge of organic matter in the canal and, therefore, will reduce oxygen\nconsumption. Furthermore, modeling performed by National Grid and NYCDEP using\nindependent models suggests that, under the scenario where CSO discharges have not\nbeen reduced and the Flushing Tunnel is operating, dissolved oxygen concentrations\nwould be near the dissolved oxygen standard. As a result, under the selected remedy\nwith reduced CSO discharges and removal of the chemical contaminants from the canal\nbottom, improvements to dissolved oxygen levels, while not evaluated, may be\nsignificant. This position is consistent with the findings of each of the major NYCDEP\nreports on the canal since 1983. The reports have consistently indicated that both the\nCSO discharges and the CSO-impacted sediment are major factors in reduced\ndissolved oxygen levels:\nCSO outfall solids produce a solids mound at the head of the Canal that causes\nhigh sediment oxygen demand (SOD). SOD in other areas of the Canal result\nfrom settled solids but to a lesser degree.” (NYCDEP, Inner Harbor CSO Facility\nPlanning Project, Modeling Report, December 1993, page C-1).\nOrganic material deposited through the settling of combined sewer overflow over\nmany years is present in the Canal. Removal of this material may reduce\nsediment oxygen demand (SOD) which contributes substantially to low dissolved\noxygen levels. Another benefit of dredging is the improved aesthetics of the\nwaterbody by removing sediment mounds which are visible during low tide.\nDredging of the Canal was recommended under the Gowanus Canal 201\nFacilities 'Plan. (NYCDEP, Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Final\nDraft Facilities Planning Report, July 1993, page 7-31).\nAt the head of Gowanus Canal where the largest dissolved oxygen deficits were\ncalculated, CSOs contribute up to about 70 percent of the total deficit, with CSO\ndischarges from the Gowanus Pump Station alone accounting for up to 67\npercent of the total deficit. Stormwater discharges, background (Upper New York\nBay) dissolved-oxygen deficits, and residual sediment oxygen demand account\nfor the remaining 30 percent of the deficit. Point source pollutants have been\nidentified as being the major contributor to the water quality impairments found in\nV-26\nGowanus Canal (NYSDEC, 2002)…. In the Gowanus Canal watershed, point\nsource loadings originate from the combined sewer system, and/or from storm\nsewer discharges. These discharges are the source of high organic-content\nsolids and coliform, which ultimately promote low dissolved oxygen conditions,\nhigh coliform concentrations, and formation of sediment mounds with high\nsediment oxygen demand (SOD).” (NYCDEP, Receiving Water Quality Modeling\nReport, 2007, page 2-6 and 3-13).\nAs discussed elsewhere, the EPA believes that a range of remedial benefits support the\ncomplete removal of the soft sediment. Similarly, a range of benefits support a\nrestoration of increased upper canal depths, including non-commercial navigation needs\nand protection of the cap. These remedial benefits do not appear to be offset by the\nlimited risk that dissolved oxygen will be negatively impacted by increased depths. In\nthe unlikely event that such increased water depths are shown in the future to have\nsevere negative impacts on dissolved oxygen, the canal depth could be readily\ndecreased through the addition of clean fill material as needed to mitigate those\nimpacts.\nDredging Challenges\nComment #19: NYCDEP and National Grid assert that the Proposed Plan does not\nconsider how dredging operations should be conducted in view of the challenges\npresented by the canal conditions. Site specific restrictions and future use need to be\nconsidered. Items that need to be considered include:\n Bathymetry\n Canal width\n Infrastructure\n Debris\n Waterbody access\n Currents\n Coordination of removal, treatment, and disposal\n Geotechnical conditions\nResponse #19: The EPA agrees that the canal presents challenging conditions (limited\nspace, water depths, bathymetry, CSOs, potential impacts to the public, etc.). Many of\nthe technical challenges listed in the comments were considered at the conceptual level\nin the FS report (for example, potential for sediment resuspension during dredging is\naddressed through the use of sheet pile cells). Operational challenges, such as narrow\nwidth and limited land access, will be further explored and addressed during the design.\nA detailed layout of the entire dredging, stabilizing and disposal process will be\nprepared as part of the design, integrating the identified challenges.\nNYCDEP is currently required by its order with the State to conduct a more limited\ndredging at the head of the canal. If implemented, this dredging would require, to a\nlesser extent, addressing many of the same constraints, including bulkhead stability,\nresuspension, capping and site limitations. Based on the EPA’s experience with other\nsediment sites, the selected remedy is implementable.\nV-27\nDredging Design Criteria\nComment #20: NYCDEP and National Grid note that the Proposed Plan did not\nconsider dredging design criteria. They asserted that factors that need to be considered\ninclude:\n Tolerances\n Slopes\n Volumes\n Treatment\n Disposal\n Schedule and length of activities\nResponse #20: The selected remedy considered these criteria in a conceptual manner.\nThe criteria will be addressed in detail during the remedial design.\nPotential Impacts to Public\nComment #21: The PRP Group notes that dredging could have negative impacts on the\npublic. It will bring NAPL to the surface of the water, and it is expected that odorous\nvolatile constituents will be released to the atmosphere from the water surface.\nResponse #21: The short-term and long-term impacts of the dredging and capping\nalternatives were evaluated as part of the FS. Releases of NAPL during dredging were\nidentified as a significant concern and an approach to address it was included in the\nremedial alternatives. Releases of NAPL will also be addressed by using best\nmanagement practices during dredging to minimize release of suspended sediments\nand NAPL. Air monitoring will be conducted and mitigation measures will be\nimplemented during the remedial activities to control release of hazardous volatile\norganic compounds.\nSediment Resuspension and Residual Contamination\nComment #22: National Grid opines that resuspension evaluations with appropriate\nmodeling are needed to predict suspended solids concentrations as a function of\ndistance and time, resuspension rates, related potential for contaminant release to\nwater and air and residual sediments. No such evaluations were conducted or even\nconsidered in developing the Proposed Plan.\nResponse #22: Modeling of sediment resuspension and estimation of resuspension\nrates will be performed as part of the remedial design. These will be compared to\nperformance standards to evaluate the appropriate operational and engineering\ncontrols.\nSince the placement of the cap is envisioned as taking place after the generated\nresiduals have settled, it is not clear why the presence of “residual sediments” would be\na concern, especially when the entire footprint of the canal is to be dredged and the\nentire dredging footprint will be capped.\nV-28\nSheet Pile Enclosed Cells and Treatment of Water Within Cells\nComment #23: National Grid states that mechanical dredging may be the most suitable\ntechnology for dredging in the canal. National Grid notes that the Proposed Plan\nassumes that all dredging and capping will be conducted within the enclosures, the\nenclosures will capture all resuspended sediment and overlying water from the\nenclosures will be treated prior to opening the enclosures. Specific issues with this\napproach include:\n No technical evaluations and consideration of the potential negative impacts of\nimplementing such controls.\n The effect of channel narrowing from these enclosures was not considered.\n The proposed treatment of the impacted cell water would be inadequate.\nConcentration of the impacted water would create odors\nNational Grid suggests that the ROD allow flexibility in the type of controls needed.\nResponse #23: The ROD allows flexibility in how the dredging will be performed. Sheet\npile enclosures were selected as the representative sediment resuspension control due\nto the presence of NAPL in the sediments. The approach for controlling resuspension\nand the use of sheet pile enclosures to achieve this will be finalized during the design.\nAlternative approaches, including the use of reinforced silt curtains, may be appropriate\nfor some sections of the canal and will be considered during the design.\nSediment resuspension controls will concentrate resuspension within a smaller area.\nAs National Grid acknowledges, mechanical dredging may be the most suitable\ntechnology for dredging in the canal, so that the best way to limit releases to air will be\nto follow dredging best management practices to minimize the disturbance of sediments\nduring the dredging process. The need for additional controls to limit releases to air will\nbe evaluated during the design.\nFor sheet pile enclosures, the number of volumes of water to be treated, the size of the\nwater treatment system, and the location of the discharge of the treated water will be\ndetermined during the design. Regardless, a sudden release of water with elevated\ncontaminant concentrations will not be allowed.\nTreatment and Disposal of Dredged Sediments\nComment #24: National Grid notes that the EPA indicates that all treatment/disposal\noptions will include barging dredged sediment to a “local on-site dewatering and transfer\nfacility.” The remedy does not account for inevitable delays due to things like:\n Public concern and releases, not to mention the very real challenges to re-handling\nand transport posed by the limited access to the canal.\n Acceptable offloading and treatment sites.\n Considerations for the special needs for stabilization and thermal treatment.\nV-29\nResponse #24: As stated previously, a detailed layout of the entire dredging, stabilizing,\nand disposal process will be prepared as part of the remedial design, integrating the\nidentified challenges.\nIdentification of a beneficial use for the stabilized material is an iterative process that\nbegins with the identification of a proposed beneficial use, development of the\nassociated performance criteria for the stabilized material for that particular use (e.g.,\nmaterial strength, leaching capacity, porosity/hydraulic conductivity, resistance to\nweathering or corrosion, etc.), and then treatability testing to determine the stabilization\nrequirements (e.g., reagents, mix ratios, curing times) that will result in meeting the\nestablished performance criteria. Preliminary beneficial uses currently identified are\nbased on contacts with landfill operators and other vendors. These options will be\nrefined during the remedial design.\nShould landfill disposal be determined to be required, treatability testing will be\nperformed during the design phase to determine the minimum amount of\nstabilization/dewatering needed so the sediments can reliably meet the requirements of\nthe selected landfill. Also, discussions will be held with multiple landfills before a\nselection is made to ensure that the selected landfill can accept the stabilized\nsediments.\nDredging Specifics\nComment #25: Two commenters asked where the staging areas for the implementation\nof the remedy will be sited and generalized logistics related to dredging.\nResponse #25: Staging areas may be needed for one or more operations, including de-\nwatering, water treatment, construction material storage and stabilized sediment\ntransfer. The location of staging areas will be determined during the design based on\nengineering considerations, such as the size of the operation and suitable available\nland. The EPA will update the community on our staging area selection during the\ndesign. Any equipment for operations such as water treatment will be utilized only for\nthe project duration, and will be de-contaminated and removed following their use.\nDewatering and treatment of decanted water may also potentially occur on barges.\nAppropriate control measures will be used to monitor and minimize project impacts,\nsuch as noise and odor. The EPA currently anticipates that the logistics of dredging\nwithin the largely narrow canal will generally result in only limited volumes of sediment\nbeing handled at any one time. The EPA will continue the ongoing outreach with the\ncommunity regarding the project design and implementation, including monitoring and\ncontrol measures.\nComment #26: A commenter inquired as to the volume of contaminated sediment\npresent in the canal, the volume of contaminated sediment that will be dredged, the\nsediment cleanup level and the area that will be capped.\nResponse #26: Deep borings installed in the canal adjacent to Public Place by National\nGrid in 2010 indicated that contamination extends to a depth in excess of 50 feet below\nV-30\nthe sediment surface. Since it would not be practical to dredge the contaminated\nsediments to such a depth, the entire column of hazardous substance-contaminated\nsoft sediment will be dredged. Soft sediments are the sediments which have\naccumulated above the native sediments. The soft sediment layer ranges in thickness\nfrom approximately 1 foot to greater than 20 feet, with an average thickness of about 10\nfeet. The estimated volume of sediments that would be dredged is 588,000 cubic yards.\nSince highly contaminated native sediment that cannot be dredged will remain after all\nof the soft sediment is removed, sediment contaminant cleanup levels have not been\ndefined. Instead, a multilayer cap will be installed over the areas that are dredged,\nleaving a clean surface which will be monitored to ensure that re-contamination does\nnot occur. The areal extent of the capped areas will be approximately 13 acres.\nComment #27: To facilitate the implementation of the remedy at the Gowanus Canal, a\ncommenter urged the EPA to seek input on the ongoing dredging and capping effort at\nthe Onondaga Lake site.\nResponse #27: The Onondaga Lake site is a National Priorities List site. While\nNYSDEC has the lead for managing the project, the EPA was actively involved in\nremedy-selection process and the design effort and is assisting NYSDEC in the\noversight of the implementation of the remedy at that site. Relevant lessons learned\nfrom that site will be applied to the Gowanus Canal site.\nComment #28: A commenter suggested that the EPA provide estimates on how much\nthe dredging will lower the canal water depth.\nResponse #28: The water level in the canal is influenced by the tide and the water level\nin the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay. Dredging the sediments will not affect\nthe surface water level; it will only increase the distance between the water surface and\nthe bottom of the canal. After soft sediment removal and native sediment capping is\ncompleted, the anticipated water depths in RTA14 1, RTA 2 and RTA 3 are -18 feet, -22\nfeet, and -28. 5 to -41. 5 feet (NVAD88), respectively.\nHazardous Waste Disposal\nComment #29: The Sediment Management Workgroup asserts that the FS report fails\nto account for the volume of wastes requiring disposal as hazardous waste.\nResponse #29: Representative, whole-core composite samples throughout the canal\nwere collected during the RI and analyzed for toxicity characteristic leaching procedure,\nas well as reactivity, ignitibility, and corrosivity. These data are presented in Table I-20\n(Appendix I) of the RI report. The definition of hazardous waste involves a range of\nhighly specific parameters. The only parameter that exceeded any of the hazardous\n14 To facilitate the assessment and management of the canal, it was divided into three\nRemediation Target Areas (RTAs) that correspond to the upper reach (RTA 1), middle reach\n(RTA 2) and lower reach (RTA 3).\nV-31\nwaste thresholds was benzene and only at two core locations collected from the central\nportion of the canal in RTA 2. Given the limited spatial extent of the sediment with this\nexceedance, it is expected that most if not all of the dredged sediment will be classified\nas a non-hazardous waste. Although not categorized as hazardous waste, the dredged\nsediment will contain an array of hazardous substances which require proper treatment,\nhandling and disposal. During the remedial design, extensive confirmatory sampling will\nbe conducted before disposal of the sediment to confirm the above assumption made in\nthe FS and to assure that all dredged sediment is classified and managed appropriately.\nOnly a single sample contained PCBs above the 50 mg/kg threshold that triggers the\nToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). While it is possible that a small amount of\nsediment will require treatment as a TSCA-regulated waste, the spatial extent of\nelevated PCB concentrations is very limited and constrained to the turning basins.\nSites for Treatment/Disposal\nComment #30: Community Board Six asserts that in order to evaluate off-Site thermal\ndesorption and beneficial use, off-Site disposal in a landfill and off-Site cogeneration\nand beneficial use treatment/disposal options, the facilities under consideration need to\nbe identified, as does the evaluation criteria that will be used by the EPA.\nResponse #30: While facilities were contacted to explore these disposal options during\nthe preparation of the FS report, specific facilities to be used during remedy\nimplementation are not yet identified—identification of potential facilities is performed\nduring the remedial design, and a specific facility is selected during the contracting and\nsubcontracting process at the onset of remedy implementation. The treatment and\ndisposal options presented in the FS report and ROD are representative examples of\noptions and are not prescriptive to a specific facility or location.\nAll treatment and disposal facilities considered during the remedial design would be\nrequired to be EPA-approved facilities that meet the appropriate Subtitle D or Subtitle C\ndesignation per the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, depending on upon the\nfinal waste classification determination. Additional considerations that are typically\nevaluated during the selection process include the distance from the site, available\nmeans of transportation, tipping fees, degree of pretreatment required and ability to\nhandle the amount of waste generated in a given duration.\nBeneficial Use\nComment #31: National Grid and NYCDEP asserts that the beneficial use options (off-\nSite stabilization and off-Site beneficial use and off-Site stabilization and on-Site\nbeneficial use) should be defined to aid in the evaluation of these options.\nCommunity Board Six inquired whether having an abundance of beneficial use material\nas a construction product under Options D and E make the necessary capital work in\nthe Gowanus area more attractive to NYC as a cost-savings. The Board also inquired\nV-32\nas to who owns the product and can it be given back to the community in the form of\nmaking it available for capital projects.\nResponse #31: Identification of a beneficial use for the stabilized material is an iterative\nprocess that begins with the identification of a proposed beneficial use, development of\nthe associated performance criteria for the stabilized material for that particular use\n(e.g., material strength, leaching capacity, porosity/hydraulic conductivity, resistance to\nweathering or corrosion, etc.), and then treatability testing to determine the stabilization\nrequirements (e.g., reagents, mix ratios, curing times) that will result in the material\nmeeting the established performance criteria. The remedial design will consider specific\nbeneficial uses for the dredged materials. Since stabilization will occur off-Site under\nthe selected remedy, it is unlikely that the stabilized material will be used for projects in\nthe canal locality. Most likely, the stabilized material will be used for landfill cover at an\noff-Site facility.\nWhere a beneficial use is identified such that the material can be cost-effectively\nstabilized to meet the performance criteria, it is possible that some cost-savings are\nrealized for capital projects; however, since the potential cost savings are specific to\neach particular beneficial application, the potential savings would be estimated once the\napplication is identified.\nThe EPA anticipates that the PRPs who generate the waste and will be responsible for\nits disposal costs will be entitled to its residual value.\nTreatment/Disposal Options D and G\nComment #32: Community Board Six noted that concerns with treatment/disposal\noptions D (off-Site stabilization and off-Site beneficial use) and G (on-Site confined\ndisposal facility) were expressed without a clear demonstration of community\nacceptance for either option.\nResponse #32: Option G has been removed based on the lack of public acceptance\nexpressed during the public comment period. Option D will only be implemented if an\nappropriate and cost-effective means of beneficial use is identified during the remedial\ndesign.\nSoft Sediment In-Situ Stabilization In-Lieu of Dredging\nComment #33: National Grid asserts that based on the data derived from its\nstabilization tests on soft, native and combined sediments, ISS of soft sediments and\nalso combining soft and native sediment stabilization are viable alternatives to soft\nsediment removal.\nResponse #33: The EPA has reviewed National Grid’s data and agrees that ISS of soft\nsediment can be performed to increase the strength of the soft sediment, as well as that\nof the combined soft and native sediments. However, the increased strength will come\nwith a corresponding decrease in permeability over the length of the entire canal and a\ncorresponding reduction in groundwater discharge to the canal. In addition, because\nthe soft sediments contain a higher degree of water than the native sediments, more\nstabilization material will likely be required to solidify them. This would likely result in\nV-33\nan expanded mass of material, reducing canal depths and complicating the design of a\nprotective cap. For these reasons, uniform application of ISS of the soft sediment to\nallow capping is not considered a viable option for the canal.\nAs for combining soft and native sediment stabilization, the extent of the area of native\nsediment to be stabilized was not precisely identified in the comment. While preliminary\nISS target areas were identified in the FS report, the precise stabilization areas, which\nare dependent on whether mobile NAPL is present in the native sediments, will be\nidentified during the remedial design. The EPA has tested two transects within the\ntarget area identified in the FS and only one of them (adjacent to Public Place) had\nmobile NAPL. The other one, near the former Metropolitan MPG facility, had relatively\nlow NAPL impacts in native sediment which would not warrant stabilization. This\nindicates that the areas of native sediment stabilization will likely be discontinuous. If\nnative sediment stabilization is discontinuous, stabilizing soft sediment only in these\nplaces could result in severe changes in canal bottom elevation because the soft\nsediment would be dredged to a lower elevation in other areas.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Migration After Soft Sediment Removal\nComment #34: National Grid asserts that since the soft sediment has less NAPL\nimpacts than the native sediment, removal of soft sediment could actually increase\nNAPL migration to the canal.\nResponse #34: Existing subsurface NAPL is currently migrating to the canal by three\nmechanisms: lateral movement from an upland source via a connected mobile NAPL\nphase; upward transport by the hydrodynamic force of the groundwater discharge and\nebullition15 of biogenic gasses in the sediment that carry NAPL to the water surface.\nUpland source control actions are expected to remove the NAPL pathway from the\nupland areas. NAPL migration from hydrodynamic forces will be mitigated by stabilizing\nnative sediment in potentially mobile areas and constructing an active cap to control\nNAPL and dissolved-phase releases.\nObservations made by the EPA indicate that ebullition is a significant transport\nmechanism for NAPL migration.\nNYCDEP has discussed the production of substantial biogenic gas production\n(ebullition) in several reports. NYCDEP noted the following in the Receiving Water\nQuality Modeling Report – Volume 4 – Gowanus Canal , City-Wide Long Term CSO\nControl Planning Project (September 2007):\nA sediment mound that is exposed at low tides has formed at the head end of the\ncanal due to historical CSO discharges.…Particulate solids are discharged by dry\nweather overflows, CSOs and stormwater discharges. These particulate solids\nsettle to the bottom sediments of Gowanus Canal, and promote a series of\nchemical reactions that utilize dissolved oxygen in the aerobic sediment layer\n15 Ebullition is a naturally-occurring process where degradation of organic matter in sediment\nreleases gasses that can form bubbles and be transported up through the water column.\nV-34\nand the water column. As oxygen is depleted in the sediment layer, anaerobic\nreactions begin. Sediment reactions produce hydrogen sulfide, which either\noxidizes in the aerobic layer of the sediment or migrates up from the sediment\ninto the water column. The entire process is known as diagenesis. Physical\nindicators that such reactions are occurring in receiving waters are strong odors\nof hydrogen sulfide and sediment mounds at discharge points. Both indicators\nare apparent in Gowanus Canal.\nNYCDEP also presents similar analyses in the Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning\nProject – Task 4. 3B – Gowanus Canal Modeling, December 1993.\nThe EPA performed literature reviews on the conditions for NAPL migration by ebullition\nand has included a white paper on this topic as part of the Administrative Record for the\nSite. The conclusions from that analysis are as follows:\nIf NAPL is present in the sediment, through ebullition, it attaches to the bubble and\nmigrates on the surface of the bubble (or in some cases within the bubble). When the\nbubble breaks on the water surface, a NAPL sheen is released. Alternatively, some\ndroplets do not burst and eventually sink to the bottom of the water body as the gas\nescapes and the droplet becomes denser than water, thus redepositing the NAPL at a\nnew location, depending on water velocities and other factors. The amount of ebullition\ngasses generated has a direct correlation to the amount of organic matter available in\nthe sediment. Gasses released by ebullition can be a significant challenge to the long-\nterm reliability of any sediment cap. The gasses can build up under the cap and cause\na rupture through the cap, thus creating a preferential pathway. In order to prevent this\nbuildup, the gasses need to be collected and vented.\nThe soft sediment has a much higher potential for ebullition than the native sediment.\nNAPL is transported through bulkheads and up from the native sediment by the NAPL\ngradient and groundwater discharge to the canal. Once in the soft sediment, the\nupward transport of NAPL is enhanced by ebullition in the soft sediments. Transport via\nebullition likely accounts for the lower concentrations of NAPL in soft sediment\ncompared to native sediment. NAPL in the soft sediment is being stripped by ebullition\ngasses, which result in transport through the soft sediment and migration to the surface\nwater. The conditions that enhance ebullition in soft sediment compared to native are:\n The amount of TOC. TOC is a primary contributor to the potential for sediment\nebullition. The TOC of the soft sediment ranges from six to 15 percent compared to\na range in the native sediment of 0. 5 to 2. 5 percent. Some studies have indicated\nthat the rate of ebullition increases proportionally with the amount of organic content,\nresulting in an increase in ebullition rate potential six times higher for soft sediment\n(15 % TOC) over native sediment (2. 5% TOC).\n Natural Organic carbon. Organic carbon in the native sediment is chemically bound\nin coal tar and other petroleum compounds that are not highly degradable. The soft\nsediment which is dominated by the CSO discharges contains high amounts of\navailable natural organic carbon from sewage and humic materials and from more\nreadily degraded organic compounds\n Higher temperature. The soft sediments are warmer than native sediments, since\nthe soft sediments are in direct contact with the warmer surface water, whereas\nV-35\nnative sediment temperatures are controlled by groundwater temperatures. The\nwarmer soft sediment temperatures in the summer increase the rate of ebullition.\nRemoval of the soft sediment would result in much lower ebullition potential and,\ntherefore, higher long-term reliability for the cap.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Expression\nComment #35: National Grid presented an analysis by one of its consultants for\nsediment samples tested under compressive forces and concluded that the NAPL would\nnot migrate under the compressive forces of a sediment cap.\nResponse #35: The EPA has reviewed the test results and has concluded that the\nsamples tested were not representative of the soft sediment strength and the NAPL\nimpacts for many areas of the canal based on the observations stated below.\nSample Depth\nThe three Gowanus Canal sediment samples were collected “near the soft and native\nsediment” interface. A review of the boring logs and photographs from the RI report and\na recent sampling event indicate that the exact transition between soft and native\nsediment layers can be difficult to identify. A more appropriate depth horizon for the\nsamples used in the expression tests would have been from near the surface of the soft\nsediment, not near the soft-native interface.\nSample Location\nThe samples were not collected in the locations of the most severe NAPL impacts. This\ncan be seen through comparison with Figure 6A of Appendix A of the FS report, which\nshows a graph of the NAPL impacts in soft and native sediment. A boring was taken\nnear Public Place former MGP facility, but it was not tested due to poor recovery.\nTherefore, the most severe NAPL impacts in soft sediment were not tested in this\nanalysis.\nSample Strength\nThe EPA notes that in the photographs that were provided, the samples are standing\nwithout support in the vertical position. The strength of these samples appears to be\nmuch firmer than the strength of the soft sediment samples collected by the EPA. The\nability for soft sediments to “stand on their own” was not observed for the soft sediment\nsamples collected by the EPA.\nBeyond these direct technical conclusions regarding the soft sediment, the EPA\nbelieves that there are numerous additional considerations in support of soft sediment\nremoval. These factors, which are discussed in detail elsewhere, include treatment of\nprincipal threat waste, increased cap reliability, reduction of potential vessel damage to\nthe cap and decreased risk of contaminant migration in the event of cap failure.\nV-36\nSignificance of Soft Sediment Contamination\nComment #36: National Grid asserts that the benefits of removal of complete sets of\ncontaminants present only in soft sediment (PCBs and metals) should be weighed with\nthe high costs of complete removal, the likelihood of cap failure and the higher\nconcentrations of other contaminants (PAHs) in native sediments.\nResponse #36: While the costs of soft sediment removal are relatively high, so are the\ncosts of the other feasible options that were considered. There are many factors, other\nthan cost, that contributed to the EPA’s decision to remove the soft sediment such as\nthe technical considerations that were described above. Soft sediment removal would\nresult in increased confidence in remedy reliability and effectiveness, implementability,\nand improved navigation.\nCapping Soft Sediments As Alternative to Dredging\nComment #37: National Grid asserts that capping on top of soft sediments is a viable\noption.\nResponse #37: Constructing a cap on top of the soft sediment is technically feasible,\nbut it would not be as reliable as the selected dredging remedy. Capping on top of the\nsoft sediment has several uncertainties pertaining to the long-term reliability and short-\nterm risks which were described in the screening of the remedial alternatives in the FS\nreport.\nRecent studies performed by National Grid have provided additional information on the\ngeotechnical stability of the soft sediment to support a cap. The EPA’s analysis of the\ngeotechnical data for the soft and the native sediment indicates that the factor of safety\nfor settlement increases by a factor of eight for capping on top of the native sediments\ncompared to capping on top of the soft sediments. For example, continued\ndecomposition of the soft sediment produces gas and liquid byproducts, complicating\ncap design. The increased factor of safety provides additional long-term reliability for the\ncap and justifies the removal of soft sediment.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid and Dissolved Phase Loading of Active Cap\nComment #38: NYCDEP opines that additional study and analysis is required on the\nconceptual design of an active cap before it can be included in the remedy. These\nstudies should address the NAPL and dissolved phase discharge.\nResponse #38: Oleophilic clay used for absorption of organic contaminants in sediment\ncaps is a well developed technology. Numerous studies were listed in the FS report\nwhere oleophilic clay caps have been used successfully. Studies conducted by the\nEPA are being used to assess the potential range of expected discharge rates of NAPL\nand dissolved phase contaminants from the native sediments. These discharge rates\nwill be largely influenced by the groundwater upwelling velocity into the canal. The EPA\nV-37\nis further planning to utilize Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS)16 or other\ntechnology in a portion of the canal to better understand the characteristics of\ngroundwater upwelling. These data will be used to estimate groundwater discharge\nrates and refine the cap design as appropriate based on location-specific\ncharacteristics. However, additional technologies (such as ISS) will be used in\ncombination with active capping in certain areas to limit contaminant loading rates and\nreduce the amount of oleophilic clay required.\nAllowance for Alternative Cap Design Configurations\nComment #39: National Grid states that a cap with treatment, isolation and armor layers\nmay be appropriate for some portions of the canal, however, since the dimensions and\ncompositions of these layers will require a substantial design effort; they should not be\nprescribed in the ROD.\nResponse #39: The details of the active cap will be specified during the remedial\ndesign. The ROD includes only the conceptual cap configuration.\nNeed for Absorptive Layers on In-Situ Stabilization Treated Areas\nComment #40: National Grid states that a treatment layer of oleophilic clay is likely not\nneeded over solidified sediment since the solidification process dramatically reduces\ncontaminant mobility. An armor layer is also likely not needed over solidified sediments,\nsince the sediments are less susceptible to scour. A benthic habitat layer could be\ninstalled over the ISS treatment areas.\nResponse #40: The EPA agrees that the use of ISS to stabilize highly impacted NAPL\nareas will be an effective technology to control NAPL migration. Results of studies\nperformed since the Proposed Plan was issued verify the ability of ISS to limit NAPL\nand dissolved phase migration. This reduction in migration potential is largely the result\nof a significant reduction in sediment permeability. Although groundwater discharge\nthrough ISS-treated native sediment areas is greatly reduced, the low permeable ISS\nareas may still allow some groundwater flow under certain conditions. For example,\ngroundwater flow could pass through the ISS treated area if fractures were to develop.\nTo provide greater long-term reliability of the sediment remedy, some form of treatment\nlayer cap over the ISS sediment is required. The type and thickness of the treatment\nlayer in the ISS areas will be evaluated in pilot testing during the remedial design.\n16 DTS uses fiber optic cables, paired with specialized electronics and software, to precisely and\ncontinuously measure temperature at thousands of locations over long distances and large\nareas. By precisely monitoring temperatures in sediment it is possible to locate where\ngroundwater is seeping through sediments and into bodies of water. Recent developments of\nthis technology also allow groundwater discharge rates to be estimated.\nV-38\nUse of Low Permeability Caps in Remedial Design\nComment #41: National Grid opines that it is premature to eliminate the option of a low\npermeability cap before the design process identifies potentially appropriate\ntechnologies to address this concern. The EPA should have discussed the implications\nof an impermeable cap that could be subjected to potential uplift, and/or groundwater\nwould be redirected around the cap and result in discharge along preferential pathways,\nsuch as bulkhead interfaces.\nResponse #41: Low permeability caps are listed in Table 3-3 of the FS report as a type\nof active cap and will be considered in the planned pilot-testing during the remedial\ndesign. The EPA does not consider low permeability caps alone to be as reliable for the\nconditions presented at the Site as absorptive caps in NAPL impacted areas and has,\ntherefore, added ISS for added protection in these areas.\nGas Collection Under Active Cap\nComment #42: National Grid inquires as to how the cap will address methane and other\ngas generation beneath the cap which can cause potential uplift and deformation.\nResponse #42: The EPA agrees that the potential for gas collecting under the cap due\nto ebullition is a significant issue that needs to be evaluated during the pilot testing and\nthe remedial design. The EPA considers remedial measures to reduce ebullition to\nhave a significant effect on the long-term reliability of the active cap. As noted\npreviously in the responses related to soft sediment removal, the potential for ebullition\nis much greater in soft sediment than in native sediment. Therefore, removal of soft\nsediment should reduce the ebullition potential significantly.\nIf the ebullition potential from the native sediment is found to be excessive, then the\nactive cap design will incorporate mechanisms that will allow for the release of the\ngenerated gases without it damaging the active cap.\nVarying Cap Requirements Within Different Areas of Canal\nComment #43: National Grid notes that cap requirements will vary along the length of\nthe canal depending on sediment conditions, presence of NAPL, groundwater\nexpression, ebullition and navigational requirements\nResponse #43: The remedial design of the active cap will take into account the varying\ncharacteristics and conditions of different areas within the Gowanus Canal, including the\npresence of NAPL, groundwater expression, ebullition and navigational requirements.\nStudies Needed for Cap Design\nComment #44: National Grid notes that a number of studies are needed for final cap\ndesign:\nV-39\n Identify the geotechnical characteristics of the sediment layer to be capped\n Identify contaminant physical characteristics, concentrations, and fluxes\n Identify potential capping materials and their characteristics, including any\namendments that might be necessary to effectively contain contaminants\n Determine design cap thickness and composition\n Evaluate potential erosive forces that might impact a cap and the resulting\nimpacts on cap design\n Evaluate appropriate equipment and placement techniques\n Monitor performance and apply adaptive management as necessary to achieve\nremedial goals\nResponse #44: The EPA agrees that the proposed studies will likely be necessary to\ncomplete the remedial design of the active cap.\nConceptual Site Model\nComment #45: NYCDEP asserts that the CSM reflects an insufficient understanding of\nNAPL transport.\nResponse #45: The CSM development is considered by the EPA to be an iterative\nprocess, with refinements made as additional information is collected as the project\nprogresses from investigation/characterization, design, remedy implementation and\npost-remedy.\nThe EPA believes that the information in the characterization phase CSM is adequate to\nsupport the selection of a remedy. The characterization phase CSM integrates key\ngeologic, hydrogeological and chemical data that supported an effective screening of\nremedial alternatives and selection of a remedy. Contaminant nature and extent and\nmigration pathways are identified. The information in the characterization phase CSM is\nadequate for use in the FS and remedy selection.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Spatial Distribution\nComment #46: The PRP Group asserts that there is insufficient information regarding\nthe spatial distribution of NAPL in the canal.\nResponse #46: The relative visual NAPL impacts in soft and native sediment were\nassessed in Appendix A of the FS report. This appendix shows the apparent\ndistribution of NAPL in soft and native sediment from over 130 different borings\nthroughout the canal, and includes plots of the spatial distribution of NAPL impacts at\nthe soft and native sediment interface. The areas that appeared to contain NAPL-\nsaturated sediment at the interface between the native and soft sediment layers were\nalso identified. Areas where NAPL-saturated sediments occur at the soft-native\nsediment interface were considered to be areas of concern for continued NAPL\nV-40\nmigration. In these areas, ISS was added as an additional remedy component in the\nFS. Additional investigations related to NAPL mobility along select transects were\nperformed following the FS and will form the basis for confirmatory design\ninvestigations.\nQuantifying Nonaqueous Phase Liquid Discharges\nComment #47: The PRP Group asserts that NAPL discharge into the canal has not\nbeen quantified.\nResponse #47: Design parameters, such as the NAPL mass transport rate, will be\ndifficult to obtain and will vary substantially throughout the canal. NAPL flowing beneath\nthe canal exists as a separate phase from the groundwater. The rate of NAPL\nmovement is based on the same principles as groundwater flow, namely, the rate is\ndependent on the applied gradient and conductivity of the media. However, the NAPL\nflows as a separate phase along preferential pathways. In addition, the effective rate of\nNAPL flow in the upland soils and in the canal sediments varies with the degree of\nNAPL saturation in the pore spaces. Identifying the geometry of the NAPL flow paths\nand knowing the NAPL content in the pore space is difficult, if not impossible, to\nestimate over the entire canal. Certain conservative design assumptions will need to be\nmade for the various areas within the canal based on specific data collected within\nthese particular areas. These design assumptions will be continually refined as the\nCSM evolves through additional data collection.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Mobility Investigations\nComment #48: NYCDEP inquired as to the specific investigations that EPA will perform\nand the data that will be collected and evaluated to verify NAPL/coal tar mobility at\nspecific locations.\nResponse #48: The EPA has already conducted NAPL mobility investigations along\nthree transects in the canal. Two of them were in RTA 2, by the Public Place and\nMetropolitan former MGP facilities and one was in RTA 3 (south of NYC’s transfer\nstation, where the canal becomes wider and deeper). Access to two transects in RTA 1\nwas not possible because the draw bridges in the upper reach of the canal became\ninoperable following Superstorm Sandy.\nLocations for these investigations were selected so as to sample a range of NAPL\nimpacts that had been documented in the RI. Samples were collected and analyzed for\npore fluid saturation (the percent of the pore volume occupied by NAPL), general\nchemistry and NAPL mobility. For the NAPL mobility tests, samples of undisturbed\nsediment (with the pore fluids retained) were tested with equipment that can simulate\nthe groundwater discharge to the canal and qualitatively measure the NAPL discharge.\nThese tests were performed to determine the range of NAPL impacts and\nhydrogeological conditions that will allow continued NAPL transport to the canal.\nV-41\nThe tests have shown that NAPL can move upward from native sediment at the\ngroundwater discharge rates predicted for the canal in higher impact areas. Figure 5,\nbelow presents a photograph of a native soil core segment held in a device that allows\nwater to be pushed upward through the core and the resulting NAPL migration at the\nstart and end of the test.\nPhoto Log (left to right)\n1. Native soil core in test\ndevice\n2. Soil core prior to\nwater injection\n3. Top view of mobile\nNAPL emerging from\nsoil core\n4. Top view after\ncompletion of water\ninjection\nFigure 5: Native soil core segment is held in device that allows water to be pushed upward\nthrough the core resulting in NAPL migration (dark brown material in the photo) at start and end\nof test.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Deeper than Six Feet in Native Sediment\nComment #49: NYCDEP inquired as to what investigation criteria will be utilized to\ndetermine the lateral and vertical dimensions of NAPL/coal tar in native deposits deeper\nthan six feet beneath the soft sediments.\nResponse #49: Native sediment NAPL at depths greater than five feet beneath the\nnative-soft interface were not investigated during the RI because this NAPL was\nconsidered to be unlikely to migrate to the canal surface or it could be controlled by\nactions taken in shallower native sediment. For deeper NAPL to be upwardly mobile, it\nV-42\nwould need to have a migration pathway through the shallower native sediments. The\nmigration pathways for the deeper NAPL can be effectively mitigated by remedial\nactions within the upper few feet of native sediment. The FS assumed that ISS would\noccur in the upper 5 feet of native sediment, but the actual depth of ISS required will be\noptimized during the design phase. Blocking these pathways with the ISS is considered\nan effective technology to prevent deeper NAPL from rising to the sediment surface.\nRemoval of Native Sediment\nComment #50: Community Board Six noted that the remedy does not include the\nremoval of the native sediment which is impacted by NAPL.\nResponse #50: In general, removal of native sediment to deeper depths presents\nsignificant engineering structural challenges to the bulkheads and other structures along\nthe canal. Additionally, boring logs from the RI and other studies have shown significant\nNAPL contamination at depths over 50 feet beneath the current bed of the canal, which\nis well outside the range for feasible removal. As noted above, by limiting the potential\nmigration pathways through the stabilization of the shallower native sediments, the\nNAPL contamination at depth can be effectively immobilized and prevented from\nentering the canal.\nControlling Upland Nonaqueous Phase Liquid Sources\nComment #51: Community Board Six inquired as to how the upland sites that are\ndischarging NAPL would be controlled. The Board noted that NAPL discharges may not\nbe controlled from the former MGP facilities since remedial plan commitments do not\nexist for two of the three former MGP facilities. The Board also noted that the majority\nof the NAPL constituents are LNAPL, and it was found to be in greatest concentration in\nthe native sediment in RTA 2 and LNAPL has a tendency to rise to the height of the\nwater table over time.\nResponse #51: The former MGP facilities are being characterized and addressed under\nthe State Superfund and Brownfield Cleanup programs by National Grid, a PRP for\nthese facilities, as well as for the canal. The EPA believes that the upland remedial\nactions implemented by National Grid will be sufficient to prevent continued NAPL\ndischarge to the canal from the NAPL sources identified in the former MGP facilities.\nFor the Fulton former MGP facility, near the head of the canal, and the Public Place\nformer MGP facility, at the middle of the canal, these measures include a cut-off barrier\nwall and NAPL collection system to prevent NAPL migration into the canal.\nFurthermore, at the Public Place former MGP facility, for which a remedy has been\nselected, excavation of tar source areas to a depth sufficient to prevent further releases\nto the canal is also part of the remedy. Source area excavation at the former Fulton\nMGP facility is also likely.\nAn investigation and partial source control cleanup was implemented at the Metropolitan\nformer MGP facility, the third and most southerly former MGP facility. Since there are\npotential source areas at this former MGP facility that were not addressed by the actions\ntaken to date, an RI is currently underway. Potential remedies for the Metropolitan\nV-43\nformer MGP facility include the same components that will be implemented at the other\ntwo former MGP facilities: construction of a cutoff wall between the former MGP facility\nand the canal, removal of remaining major mobile coal tar sources and recovery of coal\ntar product collected in the approach to the cut-off wall. These control measures are\nexpected to address releases from the three former MGP facilities. In the unlikely event\nthat a timely and effective state-selected remedy is not implemented at a given former\nMGP facility, the EPA may implement actions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure the\nprotectiveness of the selected canal remedy.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Discharges by Removing Soft Sediment\nComment #52: National Grid noted that the removal of soft sediment will expose native\nsediment which has relatively higher NAPL impacts and, thus, will increase NAPL\nmobility.\nResponse #52: NAPL can be mobilized upward through native sediment when the\nNAPL content is sufficiently high such that it can form an interconnected phase in the\npore space. It can also mobilize upward when the groundwater upwelling velocity into\nthe canal is sufficient to overcome the relatively high density of the NAPL compared to\nthe groundwater. Testing has shown that NAPL in the canal can be mobilized upward,\nbut only in areas of severe NAPL impacts and in areas where the groundwater\nupwelling velocities are high.\nIn certain areas of the canal, the removal of soft sediment will expose native sediment\nwith high NAPL impacts. However, areas of mobile NAPL in the native sediment will be\ntargeted for ISS which will result in preventing NAPL discharges to the canal bottom\nfrom these areas. The EPA has completed bench-scale testing on the application of\nISS to control NAPL migration, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of this\ntechnology.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Discharges Overwhelming Active Cap\nComment #53: NYCDEP opines that NAPL discharges from the canal bottom will\noverwhelm the active cap.\nResponse #53: The active cap configuration utilized in the development of alternatives\nin the FS included an oleophilic clay cap with isolation and armoring layers above the\noleophilic layer. This was selected as a representative cap configuration in accordance\nwith Section 4. 2. 5 of the EPA Guidance for Conducting Remedial Investigations and\nFeasibility Studies under CERCLA (EPA 1988) as noted in Figure 6.\nV-44\nFigure 6: Section 4.2.5 of the EPA Guidance for Conducting Remedial Investigations and\nFeasibility Studies under CERCLA\nA generalized cap design was specified in the FS report for the purpose of evaluating\nremedial alternatives. However, the specific design elements and precise location of\nthe active cap will be refined during the remedial design.\nIntegration of ISS with the active cap will prevent NAPL from overwhelming the\noleophilic clay’s NAPL absorption capacity. When applying ISS in the native sediment,\nadsorbents or other reagents are mixed into the sediment and contribute more\nadsorptive capacity to the overall cap configuration in comparison to a cap where the\nadsorption materials are provided only as a cover/cap on top of the sediment.\nDispersing or mixing the reagents in the native sediment in such a manner to meet\nspecific performance criteria may be more beneficial and cost effective than utilizing a\nsingle top adsorptive cap layer. In areas with suspected NAPL migration, a combination\nof these two approaches will increase remedy effectiveness. Oleophilic clay caps can\nabsorb significant amounts of dissolved phase organic contaminants from the\ngroundwater diverted around the ISS zones. Other active cap designs (e.g., the use of\nabsorbent mats) will be evaluated in other areas of the canal where the potential for\nNAPL migration is low.\nSediment Processing\nComment #54: A commenter noted that the sediments dredged from the upper and\nmiddle reaches of the canal are to be subjected to \"off-Site\" treatment and disposal.\nThe commenter sought confirmation that the off-Site treatment and disposal facilities\nare not the proposed Red Hook dewatering and treatment facility.\nResponse #54: Treatment and disposal of all of the dredged sediments from the canal,\nincluding upper, middle and lower reaches, will not occur in Red Hook or at any other\nlocation near the project area. Instead, such treatment and disposal will occur at a\nlicensed, permanent off-Site facility.\nAs indicated in Response 25, staging areas may be needed for one or more operations,\nincluding de-watering, water treatment, construction material storage and sediment\nV-45\ntransfer. The location of one or more potential areas for such operations will be\ndetermined during the remedial design. The EPA will conduct outreach with the\ncommunity regarding the project design and implementation, including staging areas\nand associated monitoring and control measures to be implemented at the staging\nareas.\nComment #55: A commenter asked how the dredged sediments would be processed.\nSeveral commenters suggested that the sediments be dewatered on barges, rather than\non the banks of the canal. Another commenter asked that the dewatering process be\ndescribed. A third commenter suggested that consideration be given to dewatering the\nsediments on the water away from residential areas, such as in the south end of Atlantic\nBasin or near Industry City. A commenter asked where the on-Site dewatering of the\ndredged sediments will take place. A commenter suggested that the burden of\ndewatering be equally borne by all of the communities along the canal.\nResponse #55: To the extent practicable, dewatering may take place on barges. The\ndredged sediments would be loaded onto special barges which will allow the solids to\nsettle to the bottom of the barge. The overlying water would then be pumped into\nholding tanks located at a temporary on-Site staging area (as noted, the location of the\nstaging area will be selected during the remedial design), treated to remove\ncontaminants in an on-Site temporary water treatment system and discharged back to\nthe canal. The dewatered sediment will then be transported by barge to an off-Site\ntreatment facility for stabilization.\nConsidering the narrow width of the canal, its active maritime use by a number of local\ncompanies and the need to use dredges and barges for, the dredging, capping and\nsediment dewatering will present a number of logistical complexities and challenges.\nThese challenges will need to be worked out during the remedial design. Appropriate\ncontrol measures will be used to monitor and reduce/address project impacts such as\nnoise and odor.\nThe EPA acknowledges the desire of the community to minimize and distribute the\nburdens associated with comprehensively addressing the long-standing canal\ncontamination currently impacting the various neighborhoods. As a practical matter,\ntemporary project impacts related to the dredging, CSO controls, remediation of the\nthree former MGPs and other project-related work will occur throughout the length of the\ncanal.\nComment #56: A commenter asked where the dredged sediments would be stabilized.\nResponse #56: The stabilization of the sediments will be performed off-Site.\nComment #57: Two commenters asked where the off-Site stabilization and beneficial\nuse will take place.\nV-46\nResponse #57: The facility that will perform the off-Site stabilization and the location of\nthe off-Site beneficial reuse will be determined during the remedial design. Typically,\nafter the EPA has approved the remedial design, the parties carrying out the cleanup\nsolicit bids from EPA-approved disposal facilities.\nComment #58: A commenter asked how dry dewatering would make the sediments.\nResponse #58: Maximizing the removal of water from the sediments will reduce the\ntotal sediment volume and mass, thereby reducing the cost of transportation and\ndisposal. On the other hand, more aggressive removal of water from the sediments will\nincrease the cost of handling and treating the sediments. To find a cost-effective\napproach, the extent of the sediment dewatering that will be performed will be\ndetermined during the remedial design.\nComment #59: A commenter expressed concern that an on-Site waste treatment facility\nwould pose a threat to the residents of Red Hook.\nResponse #59: The intent of performing remedies at Superfund facilities is to protect\npublic health and the environment. The EPA is required to implement Superfund\nremedies in a manner which is also protective of public health and the environment in\nthe short term. In general, hazardous substances in contaminated sediment present\nlong-term human health risks, rather than acute risks from short-term exposure. As a\nresult, removing contaminated sediment from an uncontrolled environment to a carefully\nengineered and controlled manner reduces exposure.\nAs was noted previously, a CDF will not be part of the selected remedy. A temporary\nfacility may potentially be required for de-watering and/or water treatment. The need for\nand the nature of any such on-Site facilities will be determined during the remedial\ndesign process.\nIf such a facility is needed, recognizing that the sediments in the canal are contaminated\nwith a number of volatile organic compounds, the treatment facility would be designed\nto handle the sediments in a controlled manner that protects the remediation workers\nwho are in regular proximity to the material and the public from air emissions or other\nreleases. The specific measures to control the air emissions during the processing of\nthe sediments will be developed during the design of the remedy. In addition, air\nmonitoring equipment will be placed at various locations in the vicinity of the processing\nareas to ensure that the air emission and odor controls are effective. The EPA will\nconduct ongoing outreach with the community regarding the project design and\nimplementation, including monitoring and control measures.\nSediment Treatment/Disposal\nComment #60: Two commenters asked for clarification regarding the disposition of the\nsediments dredged from the lower portion of the canal as compared to the middle and\nupper portions of the canal.\nV-47\nResponse #60: Three former MGPs are located in the middle and upper reaches of the\ncanal. As a result, the sediments located in the middle and upper reaches of the canal\nare much more contaminated than the sediments in the lower reach of the canal. The\nsediments from the middle and upper reaches will, therefore, require treatment and\ndisposal at off-Site facilities. The sediments from the lower reach of the canal were\ndetermined to be more suitable for treatment via stabilization and either reuse off-Site or\nplacement in an on-Site CDF. As noted above, an on-Site CDF will not be utilized, so\nthe sediments from the lower portion of the canal will also be sent to an off-Site facility.\nComment #61: A commenter expressed the belief that any disposal or treatment options\nwhich include on- or off-Site beneficial use should be eliminated from consideration,\nsince these options would require close monitoring for many years to make sure that the\nmaterials do not escape into the environment. Another commenter expressed concern\nabout the long-term stability of the stabilized sediment if used as daily cover in a landfill.\nResponse #61: The most practical potential off-Site beneficial use option for the\nstabilized sediment would be use as daily cover in a sanitary landfill. Further\nevaluations would be required to confirm the amounts and types of stabilizing agents\nthat would need to be added to the sediment to result in the desired physical and\nchemical properties. Tests to assess the leachability of contaminants, as well as the\nmaterial strength, would need to be performed on the stabilized material in order to\ndetermine whether it would meet the beneficial use requirements.\nMonitoring would be performed at the landfill regardless of whether stabilized sediments\nare used as daily cover.\nComment #62: Three commenters expressed concern that the off-Site transport of\napproximately six hundred thousand cubic yards of dredged sediments would require\ntwenty thousand truckloads, assuming that trucks with a capacity of thirty cubic yards\nare used. Since the remediation would be taking place on the waterfront, several\ncommenters suggested that barges be used for transport.\nResponse #62: The remedy calls for the utilization of barges for the transport of\ndredged sediment. Barges will also be used, to the extent possible, to limit traffic\nimpacts related to the delivery of equipment and supplies and the transport of materials\nto the work area.\nComment #63: A commenter expressed concern that the Proposed Plan does not\nprovide an example of an incinerator similar to the one proposed for the Site nor does it\nprovide an example where incinerated waste mixed with cement was safely used as fill.\nResponse #63: The remedy includes off-Site thermal treatment of the NAPL-impacted\nsediments dredged from the upper and mid-reaches of the canal, not on-Site\nincineration. The treated sediment will be transported for beneficial use, such as daily\ncover at a landfill, at an off-Site location.\nV-48\nComment #64: A commenter expressed concern that thermal desorption is not suitable\nfor heavy metals. The commenter also expressed concern that a study of possible air\npollution was not performed since some of the metals would vaporize during thermal\ntreatment.\nResponse #64: The NAPL-contaminated sediments located in the upper and mid-\nreaches of the canal constitute source materials that act as a reservoir for the migration\nof contamination. These materials are highly toxic and mobile. For this reason, the\nremedy calls for the NAPL-impacted sediments to be treated off-Site with thermal\ndesorption, followed by beneficial reuse off-Site (e.g., landfill daily cover). Emissions\nresulting from thermal treatment process would be collected and treated. Tests to\nassess the leachability of contaminants, including metals, would need to be performed\non the stabilized material in order to determine whether it would meet the beneficial use\nrequirements.\nSediment Remediation\nComment #65: A commenter suggested that consideration be given to using Opflex®\nproducts to address the contaminants attributable to the CSOs and discharges from the\nformer MGP facilities.\nResponse #65: Opflex® products are used to absorb oil and chemical spills on the\nwater surface. While this product is suitable for accidental spills and may be\nappropriate to prevent the migration of contaminants during dredging, it does not appear\nto be suitable for CSOs and ongoing releases from the former MGP facilities because of\nthe volume of contaminants that are being released. In addition, the placement of the\nproduct and its retrieval would be extremely labor intensive.\nComment #66: Given the possibility of an accidental spill, breakdown or storm damage,\na commenter suggested that all dredged materials be treated off-Site.\nResponse #66: As was noted in a previous response, the implementation of remedies at\nSuperfund sites must be undertaken in a manner which is also protective of public\nhealth and the environment. To prevent the migration of contaminants should a spill or\nbreakdown occur, designs typically include berms or other containment measures. In\naddition, the treatment system can be secured in the event of an impending storm to\nprevent releases. The EPA will take into account lessons learned from Superstorm\nSandy in siting and designing any materials handling operations. It should be noted\nthat, due to the configuration of the canal and the logistical complexities of working at\nand around the canal, it is anticipated that the amount of dredged material being\nhandled at any given time will be relatively limited.\nV-49\nRestoration of Turning Basins\nComment #67: Several commenters suggested that the 5th Street basin, an extension of\nthe 4th Street basin that was filled in between 1953 and 1965, be included in the clean\nup. One commenter stated that although the Proposed Plan expressed concern that\nexcavating the 5th Street turning basin could potentially damage structures near it, but\nthat protecting the structures during the remediation would not be insurmountable.\nResponse #67: Analytical data obtained during the RI in the former 1st Street turning\nbasin showed the existence of significant contamination in the fill and the underlying\ngroundwater. As with other former turning basins along the canal, it is believed that\ncontaminated sediments within the 1st Street turning basin were left in place when the\nbasin was filled in. In addition, there are indications that the fill itself may have included\nwaste materials. The filled-in turning basin may also have been subject to later spills\nand dumping. The basin is hydraulically connected to the canal (with no bulkhead\nstanding between the canal and the basin) such that contaminants within the basin are\nan ongoing source of contamination. The Proposed Plan did not include the excavation\nof the 5th Street turning basin since the levels of contamination in the fill and\ngroundwater associated with this turning basin were significantly less than the levels of\ncontamination in the fill and groundwater associated with the 1st Street turning basin. In\naddition, there was concern about the impact that excavating the turning basin would\nhave on the structural integrity of buildings on or in proximity to the 5th Street turning\nbasin. In addition, the 5th Street turning basin is private property, while the 1st Street\nturning basin is owned by NYC.\nBased upon suggestions made during the public comment period, the remedy now\nincludes the excavation and restoration of the portion of the 4th Street turning basin\nunderneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and the installation of a barrier or interception system\non the 5th Street turning basin side of the bridge. This parcel is a small part of an area\nthat was previously referred by the EPA to NYSDEC for investigation as an additional\nupland source area. The referral identified the property based on its owner, U-haul,\nrather than as the former 5th Street turning basin.\nCanal Bottom Capping\nComment #68: A commenter asked if capping the sediments would raise the bottom of\nthe canal, causing flooding.\nResponse #68: All of areas that would be capped would be dredged to depths ranging\nfrom, at minimum, the thickness of the cap to 20 feet or more. As a result, no portion of\nthe cap would be higher than the bottom of the canal as it currently exists. It should be\nnoted that the water level in the canal is influenced by the tide and the water level in the\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay, not the distance between the water surface\nand the bottom of the canal. Thus, even reducing the water depth by capping would not\naffect the surface water level under normal conditions. However, as a general matter, it\nV-50\nis anticipated that the depth of the canal will be increased in some areas. Under\nabnormal tides or surge conditions, this would result in a nominally increased flood\ncapacity in the canal.\nComment #69: Two commenters expressed concern that the armor layer may be\naffected by future storms. One of the commenters also suggested that estimates be\nmade as to how the dredging and capping will affect the canal’s water depth, particularly\nduring flooding events.\nResponse #69: The caps that will be installed in the canal following dredging will be\nsubjected to a number of physical stresses, including tidal currents, wind wave-\ngenerated currents, ice and debris scour and propeller wash. The armor layer would\nconsist of stone of sufficient size so as to prevent damage to the underlying layers.\nAltering the bathymetry of the canal by dredging and capping will not affect the canal’s\nwater holding capacity or minimize flooding under normal conditions. Unless dikes are\ninstalled along the canal to protect against increases in the effective sea level or against\nstorm surges, as long as the areas surrounding the canal are within storm surge levels\nor below future increases in sea level, they will flood. As noted above, the anticipated\nincreases in canal depth as a result of dredging will nominally increase the canal’s\nholding capacity.\nCanal Bottom Cap Maintenance\nComment #70: Since the cap that is placed over the dredged areas in the canal would\nbe exposed continuously to salt water and would be subjected to tidal water movement\nand stormwater flow, a commenter inquired as to how the EPA will insure that the cap\nwill remain effective.\nResponse #70: Caps are commonly used in salt and fresh water bodies to contain\ncontaminated sediments. The details of the cap construction will be determined during\nthe remedial design. The conceptual design for the cap for the Gowanus Canal\nconsists of an armor layer, an isolation layer and an active treatment layer from top to\nbottom. The armor layer, which will prevent erosion of the underlying layers from future\nmaintenance dredging, boat traffic and water currents, will consist of 1.5 feet of stone\nwith a median diameter of 0.75 feet. Sufficient sand will be placed on top of the armor\nlayer to fill in the voids between the stones and to establish sufficient depth of sediment\nfor a habitat layer in order to facilitate benthic recolonization. The isolation layer will\nconsist of 0.5 feet of gravel and 0.5 feet of sand to provide protection of the treatment\nlayer from the overlying heavy armor layer. The active treatment layer, as conceptually\nconfigured, will consist of 1-1.5-foot of a specific type of clay that will absorb\ncontamination that could well up from below.\nContinuous exposure of the cap to salt water will have minimal impact on the cap.\nV-51\nComment #71: A commenter asked if it would be necessary to remove the overlying\nsand and armor layers if the oleophilic clay needs to be replaced.\nResponse #71: If possible, the oleophilic treatment layer will be designed to have a\nsufficient life expectancy for absorbing contaminants without replacement. If this is not\nfeasible, it may be possible to design targeted areas in the cap intended to facilitate\nreplacement of the oleophilic treatment layer. If these options are determined to be\nunavailable during the design, the replacement of portions of the treatment layer may\nnecessitate the removal and replacement of the overlying sand and armor layers.\nInformation on Commercial Availability of Sites to Treat Contaminated Sediment\nComment #72: NYCDEP noted that no information is provided on the commercial\navailability of facilities to treat the contaminated sediment. The availability of beneficial\nuse sites is unknown. It is unlikely that the material would be accepted at a landfill for\nuse as daily cover without being assessed a tipping fee.\nResponse #72: The identification of commercial facilities to treat the contaminated\nsediment and beneficial use sites will be determined during the remedial design. The\ncosts associated with the treatment and beneficial use will be determined during the\nremedial design.\nStabilization of Dredged Sediments\nComment #73: A commenter asked for details related to the stabilization process.\nResponse #73: Stabilization mixes materials, such as cement, into the sediment to\npermanently bind the contaminants physically/chemically. Treatability studies would\nneed to be performed to determine the best stabilization agent and other factors so as\nto ensure that contaminants are fully bound into the resulting material. Any stabilization\nconducted pursuant to the remedy will be performed off-Site.\nComment #74: A commenter expressed concern about the safety of an on-Site\nstabilization facility.\nResponse #74: At Superfund sites, treatment facilities are designed to comply with all\nsafety and air emission standards to protect the workers and local residents. Air\nmonitoring is conducted at the facility and along its perimeter. In the unlikely event that\nunacceptable levels of contaminants are detected, processing operations are\nterminated and measures are taken to promptly address such releases.\nHowever, as was noted previously, any stabilization conducted pursuant to the remedy\nwill be performed off-Site.\nV-52\nComment #75: Several commenters expressed concern that if stabilization of the\ndredged sediments is performed in the vicinity of the canal, untreated contaminated\nsediments would need to be stored there, thereby allowing the potential to mobilize toxic\nsubstances during a storm event.\nResponse #75: Stabilization will be done off-Site. With respect to other storm event\nimpacts, if a large storm is forecasted, all of the operations, including any materials\nstaging areas, would be secured to prevent releases. As noted above, it is anticipated\nthat the amount of dredged material being handled at any given time will be relatively\nlimited. This in turn limits the amount of materials that must be secured during a storm\nevent.\nUse of Local Concrete Mixing Facilities\nComment #76: Community Board Six inquired as to how the EPA will evaluate local\nconcrete mixing facilities relative to stabilization. The Board also inquired as to whether\nthe Brooklyn Community Board Six Responsible Development Policy will be applied to\nthe stabilization services component of the project.\nResponse #76: Vendors will be selected during the contracting process which will be\nconducted by the PRPs under the EPA’s oversight. At a minimum, mixing facilities,\nregardless of location, would need to demonstrate the ability to perform the mixing to\nthe selected performance specifications and to be able to handle the amount of material\ngenerated without causing project delays. As a general matter, the EPA supports the\nuse of qualified local vendors. Strict standards will apply with respect to appropriate\nhealth and safety training measures.\nThe EPA has reviewed the Brooklyn Community Board Six Responsible Development\nPolicy. While the EPA is not required to comply with local advisory policies, the EPA\nconsiders, to the extent possible, other project standards, such as sustainability.\nConsistent with the policy, the EPA supports the use of qualified local vendors where\npossible.\nComment #77: A commenter asked whether a local source of concrete would be used\nfor stabilization.\nResponse #77: Since dredged sediment stabilization will be done off-Site, it is unlikely\nthat a local source of cement will be utilized.\nUnderstanding Potential Impacts in Remediation Target Area\nComment #78: NYCDEP asserts that the Proposed Plan shows a lack of understanding\nof the potential impacts from ISS and the parameters of applicability to the entire\nremediation target area.\nResponse #78: In the FS, the EPA estimated the remedial target area for ISS based on\nthe visual impacts of samples collected near the soft-native sediment interface. NAPL-\nV-53\nsaturated conditions on both sides of the interface were used as an indication of high\nNAPL migration potential and were selected for ISS.\nThe EPA has performed additional studies to determine the canal conditions (i.e., NAPL\nsaturation and groundwater discharge rates) that will allow continued upward NAPL\ndischarge. The EPA has tested two locations in the ISS target area identified in the FS\nand only one (adjacent to Public Place, the former Citizens Gas Works MGP facility)\nhad mobile NAPL. The other, near the Metropolitan former MPG State Superfund site,\nexhibited lower NAPL impacts in native sediment which would likely not warrant\nstabilization. This suggests that the areas of native sediment stabilization may be\ndiscontinuous. Analyzing the impacts to the entire target area is not justified at this time\nsince the precise ISS target area(s) will be identified during the remedial design based\non the results of confirmatory design sampling.\nIn-Situ Stabilization Benefits\nComment #79: NYCDEP and the PRP Group opine that the use of ISS is based on\nunproven assumptions about its potential benefits.\nResponse #79: ISS has well established benefits that are directly applicable to the\nGowanus Canal. These benefits are listed in a recent Interstate Technology &\nRegulatory Council (ITRC) guidance document, Development of Performance\nSpecifications for Solidification/Stabilization (ITRC, July 2011). The EPA was part of the\ndevelopment team.\nISS as presented in the FS report uses a combination of solidification and stabilization\nagents to gain the benefits of both solidification and stabilization mechanisms into the\nremedial technology.\nISS is being utilized in combination with dredging and multi-layer capping. The use of\nseveral remedial components is expected to provide an increased degree of reliability in\naddressing the impacted media at the Site. As a result, even if some portion of the\nNAPL is not fully addressed by ISS, the active and passive cap components will provide\nprotective redundancy.\nNeed for Bench and Field Testing for Site-Specific Conditions\nComment #80: NYCDEP asserts that ISS has not been bench or field tested under\nconditions likely to exist in the canal.\nResponse #80: The EPA has performed bench-scale testing of ISS on native sediment\nfrom the canal. It is also anticipated that pilot-scale testing of ISS will be performed in\nthe canal during the remedial design. There are three main considerations for ISS\napplication in the Gowanus Canal that were evaluated as part of the bench scale testing\nand will also be evaluated during the pilot testing : 1) the development of successful\nmix designs; 2) field implementation under the canal conditions; and 3) integration with\nV-54\nan overlying reactive capping system. These considerations are further discussed\nbelow.\n The development of mix designs to successfully immobilize former MGP residuals is\nrelatively straightforward (EPRI, 2009a, b). The EPA performed bench-scale testing\nto evaluate mix designs for native sediment. National Grid has also tested the\napplication of ISS on native and a mixture of soft and native sediments.\n ISS implementation at the Gowanus Canal, where both landside and barge -\nmounted ISS equipment may be required, will be informed by experience in previous\nprojects, such as the Columbus Georgia Superfund site (EPRI 2003; Antemir et al.,\n2010) and others summarized by the EPA (EPA, 2000), and construction/installation\nwill be evaluated as part of the planned pilot study.\n ISS-treated media are known to be much less hydraulically conductive than the\nsandy/silty media underlying the Gowanus Canal, typically achieving hydraulic\nconductivity values of less than 10-6 cm/s. Therefore, implementation of ISS could\nlead to significant reductions in contaminant mass fluxes into the canal and the\nimmobilization of NAPL. The presence of monolithic masses may lead to flow\nbypassing of groundwater impacted by NAPL, which means that the ISS-treated\nmasses must be properly integrated with an overlying reactive capping system to\ncapture any groundwater flow bypass and strip it of its contaminants before it is\nultimately released into the canal. Construction/installation will be evaluated as part\nof the pilot testing.\nComment #81: NYCDEP asserts that ISS treatability testing should be performed prior\nto remedy selection.\nResponse #81: The EPA agrees that the treatability testing is important. This testing\nhowever, will be part of the design and is not a prerequisite for remedy selection.\nSection 5. 1. 2 of the EPA Guidance for Conducting Remedial Investigations and\nFeasibility Studies under CERCLA (EPA, 1988) presents the following guidance on\nwhen treatability testing should be conducted:\nA decision to conduct treatability testing may be made during project scoping if\ninformation indicates such testing is desirable. However, the decision to conduct\nthese activities must be made by weighing the cost and time required to\ncomplete the investigation against the potential value of the information in\nresolving uncertainties with selection of a remedial action. . . . Project managers\nwill need to make such decisions on a case by case basis. In some situations,\ntreatability investigations may be postponed until the remedial design phase.\nThe EPA has conducted bench-scale testing of native sediment stabilization (EPA,\n2013). This testing showed that ISS can be effective in increasing the strength and\nreducing the permeability of the stabilized sediments. The bench-scale testing also\nshowed that NAPL migration could be controlled through the application of ISS.\nISS was field tested in 2005 under a program funded by the New Jersey Department of\nTransportation and administered by Rutgers University (Maher, 2005). This study\ndemonstrated that sediments could be effectively stabilized in-situ.\nV-55\nCriteria for In-Situ Stabilization Performance\nComment #82: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA has not established any criteria for\nacceptable performance of the ISS or means for evaluating lab and pilot scale testing\nresults.\nResponse #82: The FS report presents the following RAOs for NAPL-impacted\nsediments:\n Prevent direct human or ecological contact with NAPL-impacted sediments\n Prevent migration of NAPL from the sediment into the overlying water column\n Prevent NAPL from providing a source to groundwater discharging to the canal from\nadversely affecting sediment or surface water quality\nIn August 2012, the EPA issued a Quality Assurance Project Plan, Addendum 1, Pre-\nDesign Data Collection, Bulk Sample Collection and Stabilization Bench Scale Testing.\nThis plan presented the following criteria for ISS performance:\nA minimum strength criterion of 20 psi unconfined compression strength is used\nin this work plan. This criterion was primarily based on the required integrity of\nmolded samples to be subjected to leachability testing (e.g., the EPA LEAF\nPremethod 1315 testing).\nTargets for final leaching concentrations will be based on the Final Chronic\nValues presented in the FS and presented in the tabulation [in Table 1]. The\nSVOCs selected for leaching concentrations are based on the composition of\nNAPL from the former MGP facilities.\nTable 1: Final Chronic Values\nDescription Final Chronic Values for PAHs\nMilligrams per Liter\nChemical\nNapthalene 0. 1935\nAcenapthene 0. 3069\nFluorene 0. 0393\nPhenanthrene 0. 0191\nPyrene 0. 01011\nJustification of and Alternatives to In-Situ Stabilization\nComment #83: NYCDEP asserts that the need for the ISS layer was not evaluated in a\nmeaningful manner in the FS report, nor were alternatives to ISS considered. To justify\nthe inclusion of ISS in the recommended remedy, additional evaluation and testing is\nrequired. The lack of specific information on the technical feasibility and\nV-56\nimplementability of the ISS process makes its inclusion in the recommended remedy\nquestionable.\nResponse #83: ISS was included in the Proposed Plan to address the RAO to “prevent\nmigration of NAPL from the sediment into the overlying water column.” Stabilization is a\nwell-established technology for NAPL-impacted media associated with former MGP\nfacilities that has recently been expanded to include application in sediment. The target\narea identified in the Proposed Plan for ISS application includes the areas most likely to\nhave continued NAPL migration from the native sediment based on visual impacts as\npresented in the RI report.\nNo other in-situ technologies were included in the remedial alternatives developed in the\nFS because no other in-situ technologies were considered applicable based on the\nresults of the technology screening. The technologies of enhanced biological\noxidation/reduction, vitrification, chemical oxidation/destruction and absorption were not\nretained for the various technical reasons described in the FS report.\nMigration of Sediments During Remediation\nComment #84: A commenter expressed concern that since there have been three 100-\nyear storms in the area in the past 10 years, it is likely that such a storm will occur\nduring the remediation effort, potentially mobilizing contaminants. Several commenters\ninquired as to what will be done to prevent the migration of contaminated sediments to\nland areas near the canal if, during the remediation of the canal, a storm event leads to\nflooding.\nResponse #84: Steps will be taken to ensure that any resuspension of contaminated\nsediment during the dredging is kept to a minimum. The EPA acknowledges the\nconcern related to damage and contamination dispersion resulting from potential storm\nsurges during the remedy construction. During remedial actions in coastal areas, it is\ncommon practice to monitor weather conditions. If storms with the potential for\nsignificant flooding or powerful storm surges are forecasted, work areas and treatment\nfacilities are secured in advance of the storm. The process can include, but not be\nlimited to, temporarily suspending removal operations in order to clear out any\nstockpiles to their final disposal destination to prevent the possibility of spreading\ndredged and stockpiled sediment into the area adjacent to the treatment facility.\nAlthough project logistics and sequencing will be determined during the remedial\ndesign, it is anticipated that dredging operations will be conducted in a series of discrete\nareas at any one time, resulting in a limited area of operation, which will need to be\nsecured during a storm event.\nIt should be noted that while the EPA’s risk assessment performed during the RI\nassumed a worst-case situation whereby material from the bottom of the canal is\ntransported via flood waters, it does not appear that that happened to any significant\nextent as a result of Superstorm Sandy in October 2012.\nV-57\nComment #85: A commenter asked whether details related to storm preparations would\nbe presented to the public.\nResponse #85: Specific details related to the implementation of the remedy will be\ndeveloped during the remedial design. It is anticipated that the design will take three\nyears to complete. During that time, it is the EPA’s intention to continue the ongoing\ndialogue with the community since the Superfund process commenced three years ago.\nThese discussions will give the EPA the opportunity to discuss the progress of the\ndesign and describe specific components of the remedy and consider public feedback.\nConfined Disposal Facility\nComment #86: A commenter asked for details related to the configuration of the CDF\nthat was proposed for Red Hook. Two commenters asked whether the CDF would be\nconstructed in conformance with the new Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(FEMA) standards which require the “ground level” to be 12 feet above the mean high\ntide. Another commenter asked whether the CDF would be designed to withstand a\nhurricane and whether it would be in compliance with NYC Department of Buildings’\ncodes.\nResponse #86: Although a CDF will not be constructed, to be responsive to the inquiry,\ndetails related to the CDF’s construction will be provided.\nIt was assumed that the CDF would accommodate the entire volume of sediment\nremoved from the lower canal (estimated at 281,000 cubic yards) and an expansion\nfactor of 1.15 (stabilization increases the volume), resulting in a CDF capacity of\napproximately 323,000 cubic yards. Constructing a CDF with a stabilized sediment\nthickness of 20 feet, would have required 10 acres. The CDF would have bordered\nwater on two sides and land on two sides. The layout would have included a single\nsheet-pile wall on the sides adjacent to land and a double sheet-pile wall on the sides\nadjacent to the water. The void in the double sheet-pile wall would have been filled with\nbentonite-augmented soil or a similar low-permeability material. Sufficient stabilization\nagents (e.g., Portland cement) would have been added to the dewatered sediment such\nthat a monolithic mass would have resulted. The material would have been transferred\ninto the CDF before it was completely hardened. Once the stabilized sediment had\nhardened, leaching would be expected to be negligible, so a leachate collection system\nwould not have been necessary. Upon placement of the stabilized sediment into the\nCDF, the top would have been capped. It is presumed that the top layer of the cap\nwould have been asphalt, allowing use of the surface. The CDF design would have\nneeded to ensure long-term effectiveness in a coastal marine environment and would\nhave needed to be approved by NYSDEC and other appropriate governmental\nregulatory authorities.\nV-58\nSince the CDF would have been designed to securely contain the stabilized dredged\nsediments within a waterway, the FEMA mean high tide requirements would not have\nbeen relevant. The cap and sheet-piled sides would have protected the stabilized\nmass from damage associated with flooding and hurricanes. Since the CDF is not a\nbuilding, NYC Department of Building codes would not have been relevant.\nComment #87: A commenter expressed concern about the potential to mobilize toxic\nsubstances from the proposed CDF, since it would be constructed in a flood zone.\n.\nResponse #87: As was described in the previous response, stabilizing the sediments\nand containing them in a CDF would have prevented the contents from releases.\nComment #88: A commenter asked for examples of where CDFs have been utilized.\nResponse #88: Confined disposal is a commonly used management approach for\ncontaminated sediments. According to the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), 45 CDF\nfacilities have been constructed to store dredged sediment in the Great Lakes. CDFs\nhave been constructed for the EPA facilities at the Milwaukee Waterway, Tacoma, WA,\nWaukegan Harbor, Inland Windmill Island, Holland, MI.\nComment #89: A commenter stated that if a CDF is constructed, it would require the\npreparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS).\nResponse #89: The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 was enacted by\nCongress to establish a framework for environmental review of actions carried out by\nthe federal government. The EPA mandates that all agencies of the federal government\nprepare an EIS when they undertake or fund \"major federal actions significantly\naffecting the quality of the human environment.” Both Congress and the courts have\ndetermined, however, that the EIS process is not applicable to the EPA actions under\nCERCLA, since the statutes that the EPA administers include information gathering and\nanalytical requirements that are functionally equivalent to the EIS process.\nComment #90: A commenter expressed concern that due to the chance that the\nstabilization could fail, stabilized sediments should not be stored in a CDF. The\ncommenter noted that the benefits of storing the stabilized sediments at Red Hook are\nnot worth the risk of human exposure. A commenter asked if the CDF is constructed,\nhow the EPA would guarantee the security and safety of his family.\nResponse #90: In the unlikely event that the entire stabilized sediment monolith or a\nportion of it failed, since the monolith would have been capped and surrounded by\nsheet-pile walls on the sides adjacent to land and a double sheet-pile wall filled with\nbentonite-augmented soil or a similar low-permeability material on the sides adjacent to\nthe water, human exposure would have been unlikely.\nV-59\nComment #91: A commenter asked how the EPA would protect the integrity the CDF\nfrom intrusive activities.\nResponse #91: Institutional controls are non-engineered instruments, such as\nadministrative and legal controls, that help minimize the potential for human exposure to\ncontamination and/or protect the integrity of remedies. Institutional controls play an\nimportant role in remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting\nland or resource use and guide human behavior at a site. If a CDF had been\nconstructed, an institutional control, such as an environmental easement, would have\nbeen used to protect the integrity of the CDF (i.e., prevent intrusive activities and restrict\nthe overlying land use).\nComment #92: A commenter noted that since institutional controls would be required\nand since monitoring would be needed because of the potential for contaminants to\nleach, the CDF should not be sited in Red Hook.\nResponse #92: As was noted above, it is unlikely that contaminants would have\nleached from the monolith or the CDF. Periodic maintenance (primarily, the cap) would\nhave been performed to assure that the CDF continued to function effectively.\nMonitoring would have been performed, primarily, to evaluate the integrity of the cap.\nThe institutional controls would have been put into place to assure that the CDF would\nremain undisturbed.\nComment #93: Two commenters expressed concern that the proposed CDF does not\naddress the impact that the placement of fill contiguous to a flood zone will have on\nfuture flood events.\nResponse #93: Creating a CDF in the existing slip would not have affected the canal’s\nwater holding capacity or increased the potential for flooding.\nComment #94: A commenter indicated that Environmental Justice (EJ) guidelines\nshould prevent the siting of a land-based dewatering facility and a CDF at the GBX\nproperty. The property is adjacent to ball fields, a popular track, park areas and an\nOlympic sized swimming pool all of which are frequently used by Red Hook residents\nand residents of neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.\nResponse #94: The operation of a land-based dewatering facility will not pose a health\nrisk to the users of the park and pool. Similarly, the construction of a CDF at the GBX\nproperty, if this had been selected, would not have posed a health risk to the users of\nthe park and pool. Health and safety precautions are implemented to protect the health\nof workers directly exposed to material being handled; this degree of controls and\nmonitoring is also designed to ensure the protectiveness of residential and recreational\nusers in adjacent areas.\nV-60\nComment #95: A commenter suggested that the CDF might also be used in dealing with\nthe 1st Street turning basin spoils, as well.\nResponse #95: There would not have been sufficient capacity in the CDF to\naccommodate sediments from the 1st Street turning basin, as suggested.\nComment #96: A commenter asked what the land overlying the CDF would be used for.\nResponse #96: The land overlying the CDF could have been used in any manner that is\nconsistent with the current industrial zoning of the surrounding property, as long as the\nuse did not entail intrusive activities into the CDF. In addition, there would have been\nlimitations on the types of structures that could be placed on top of the CDF and limits\non the types and size of plants, if any, which would have been allowed to grow on top of\nthe CDF.\nComment #97: A commenter asked whether the completed CDF could be made\navailable to the public for inspection.\nResponse #97: While the EPA could have arranged for the public to inspect the\ncompleted CDF (it would be located on private property), there would not have been\nmuch to observe, since the top layer of the cap would likely have been asphalt.\nComment #98: A commenter asked whether the EPA can use eminent domain to take\nfrom the property owner the slip where the CDF is proposed and once the CDF is\ncreated, build piers and then cede the ownership of the land to public housing residents\nin Red Hook. The commenter opined that this way, the residents of Red Hook could\nbenefit from the profits stemming from the increased waterfront property, not just the\nproperty owner.\nResponse #98: While the EPA has the authority to take the property necessary to\nimplement a remedy through eminent domain as long as the property owner receives\njust compensation, the EPA does not have the authority to develop it and turn it over to\nother private parties. The property owner proposed that the CDF would have allowed\nthe expansion of the GBX terminal, which would have increased the docking capacity.\nThe increased docking capacity would have benefited not only the property owner, but\nlocal businesses that rely upon the terminal.\nComment #99: Several commenters suggested that it be required that a CDF only be\nconstructed if there is a community benefits agreement (CBA)17 that represents\nequitable distribution of the benefits along with the community burdens of the cleanup.\nFor example, states one of the commenters, since close to 60% of the Red Hook\npopulation lives in public housing and since the owner of GBX is only one person,\n17 A community benefits agreement is a contract signed by community groups and a real estate\ndeveloper that requires the developer to provide specific amenities and/or mitigation to the local\ncommunity or neighborhood. In exchange, the community groups agree to publicly support the\nproject, or at least not oppose it.\nV-61\ndelivering a result of the cleanup that only benefits the property owner, clearly, would\nnot represent equitable distribution of the benefits. The commenter notes that if the\nEPA could gain public acceptance that the CDF would be safe, shared ownership of the\nCDF and deep sea port with the community would facilitate the CDF being built (the\nshoreline is a public good and using the EPA to change the shoreline is an end run\naround public processes states the commenter). Also, states a commenter, local jobs\nare not assured and creating jobs is not a compelling enough community benefit to\njustify supporting the construction of a CDF. The commenter notes that community\nmembers might not have proper qualifications and elderly or special needs populations\ncould not be considered. In addition, states the commenter, community job numbers\nare usually lower than forecasted. While workforce development, through the\nSuperfund Job Training Initiative (JTI), should be an integral part of the Superfund\ncleanup and jobs should be written into a CBA, the best way to share the proceeds of\nany public good resulting from the EPA cleanup would be collective ownership and\ndividend payments associated with the public good, suggests a commenter.\nResponse #99: The EPA cannot enter into a CBA, and it is not known if the PRPs that\nperform the remediation would have been willing to enter into such an agreement on\ntheir own.\nThe EPA has been a strong supporter of job training initiatives for people who find it\ndifficult to get into the work force because of inadequate education or personal\ndifficulties, such as a criminal record. The EPA anticipates supporting a job training\nprogram at the Site, regardless of the absence of a CDF.\nComment #100: A commenter asked whether there would be continuing operation of\nthe CDF in Red Hook.\nResponse #100: Once the stabilized sediments from the canal were placed into a CDF,\nit would have been capped and all of the treatment equipment would have been\ndismantled. The only subsequent actions at the CDF would have been periodic\nmonitoring and maintenance.\nComment #101: A commenter asked how the bidding process for the construction of the\nCDF would work if the location has not been identified.\nResponse #101: The location of the CDF would have been finalized during the design of\nthe remedy. Therefore, any requests-for-proposals related to the construction of the\nCDF would have specified the location.\nComment #102: A commenter asked if the entity that would be constructing and\nmaintaining the CDF has any environmental violations on its record. Another\ncommenter suggested that on-Site stabilization and placement in on-Site CDF would\nmake sense if a very experienced, reputable, reliable contractor is used.\nResponse #102: While the owner of the property where the CDF was proposed to be\nconstructed may have some environmental violations, he would have had no role in\nconstructing or maintaining the CDF. Superfund cleanup work is typically conducted by\nV-62\nexperienced, specialized remediation companies that adhere to the EPA’s high\nstandards, under EPA oversight. All of the construction work at the Site is expected to\nbe performed by the PRPs. The PRPs must provide documentation to EPA that each of\ntheir contractors is qualified.\nComment #103: Several commenters expressed concern about the long-term integrity\nof stabilized sediments placed in a CDF situated in a marine environment. Another\ncommenter expressed concern about the potential for releases from the CDF should the\ncap be damaged through an earthquake or other event.\nResponse #103: Stabilization mixes materials, such as cement, into the sediment to\npermanently bind the contaminants physically/chemically. Treatability studies would\nhave been needed to determine the best stabilization agent and other factors. The CDF\ninto which the stabilized sediments would have been placed would have been designed\nto ensure long-term effectiveness in a marine environment. Maintenance of the CDF\ncap would have been a component of the remedy. If the CDF’s cap were to become\ndamaged, it would have been repaired. Like other components of the remedy, the CDF\ncap was considered for the purposes of redundancy.\nComment #104: A commenter expressed concern that the property owner would be\nable to dump the spoils back into the canal without treatment.\nResponse #104: Since after stabilization, the sediments would have become a monolith\nand would have been contained in a CDF, it would not have been possible for the spoils\nto be dumped into the canal. Beyond providing the property, the property owner would\nhave had no involvement in the handling of the materials.\nComment #105: A commenter expressed concern that the filling in of privately owned\nlands in the Gowanus Bay section of New York Harbor with contaminated material used\nto create the CDF could leach from the CDF and further pollute the harbor.\nResponse #105: As was noted in a prior response, the stabilized sediments that would\nhave been placed into the CDF would not have leached and would have been contained\nin the CDF, by design. The EPA would not have proposed or selected an option which\nwould have increased pollution to the harbor.\nComment #106: Several commenters asked about the health risk that the stabilized\nsediments placed in the CDF would pose to nearby residents and children playing in the\nnearby ball fields.\nResponse #106: Stabilized sediments would not have leached after treatment. In\naddition, the CDF design would have provided multiple layers of additional protection.\nComment #107: Two commenters noted that for more than 20 years, noxious facilities,\nsuch as waste transfer facilities, have been sited in Red Hook. One of the commenters\nfurther stated that there is a serious lack of trust in the owner of and the lobbyist for the\nGBX property. While a commenter recognizes that GBX has the right to build whatever\nV-63\nthe zoning allows, the commenter does not want to give the company more land mass\nby constructing a CDF to facilitate such construction. Another commenter stated that\nthe expanded utilization of the property as a result of the construction of a CDF would\nundermine the value of the adjacent park and recreation areas. Another commenter\nnoted that while the pollution in the canal stretches through many neighborhoods, the\nCDF would place an undue burden in perpetuity in Red Hook and will only benefit the\nPRPs and the property owner. A commenter asked why the EPA would consider\nplacing a CDF in a flood zone. Another commenter asked how it is justified that the\nproperty owner would get essentially free land. Several commenters noted that while\nthere would be substantial cost savings constructing a CDF, only the property owner\nand his company would benefit from the CDF. Several commenters expressed concern\nthat while the CDF would reduce the cleanup expenses of the PRPs, it would not benefit\nthe community. Several commenters state that there was a paucity of outreach to the\ngeneral public with regard to the CDF option before it was proposed as an option during\na limited public comment period. Several commenters opined that the number of jobs\nthat would be created by this effort would not be significant to justify the construction of\nthe CDF. Several commenters noted that while leveraging the cleanup for local jobs is\na strong motivating factor, a significant majority of Red Hook residents are opposed to\nthe proposed CDF, believing that the creation of jobs should not be at the risk of\nphysical harm to humans.\nResponse #107: During studies done by USACE on behalf of NYC, consideration was\ngiven to the placement of untreated sediment in the 4th Street turning basin. As part of\nan associated navigation report, the owner of the GBX facility proposed to USACE that\na CDF be constructed in Red Hook.\nThe draft FS report, which identified a CDF option, was released to the public in\nDecember 2011. The EPA’s conceptual CDF approach differed from the original\nconsideration in that the sediment would be treated through stabilization. A public\nmeeting to discuss the results of the FS was held on January 24, 2012. The concept of\na CDF was introduced at this public meeting. In addition, at the meeting, it was noted\nthat two locations were under consideration–the 4th Street basin or in Red Hook.\nDiscussions about the CDF were also conducted at a number of CAG meetings.\nFollowing discussions with the property owner, the EPA identified a potential CDF\nlocation on the GBX property. The CDF could be constructed within an existing slip\nthere or within other areas of the property.\nWhile cost is one of the criteria that is assessed in evaluating remedial alternatives, the\nEPA’s primary focus is on protecting public health and the environment. Although the\nCDF would create “free land” for the property owner and would result in cost savings for\nthe PRPs, it would also provide a viable and safe means of disposing of the lesser\ncontaminated sediments. The stabilized sediments that were targeted for placement in\nthe CDF would no longer be toxic. In addition, constructing the CDF in Red Hook would\nhave provided some local jobs. Although this proposed option would have resulted in\noperations occurring in Red Hook, all of the proposed cleanup components would have\nresulted in a significant net reduction in existing impacts to the Red Hook community.\nThe selection of a remedy is based upon nine evaluation criteria–one of which is\nV-64\ncommunity acceptance. As was noted in the Proposed Plan, the decision to stabilize\nthe less contaminated sediments and either reuse them off-Site or place them in an on-\nSite CDF was evaluated based upon community acceptance. As a result, a CDF will\nnot be constructed, and the materials will be sent off-Site.\nComment #108: A commenter opined that since several thousand people expressed\nopposition to the construction of the CDF via petitions, postcards, emails, letters and in\nmeetings, the community does not accept the CDF.\nResponse #108: While approximately 900 parties located in Red Hook, elsewhere in\nNew York State and in other states expressed opposition to the construction of the CDF\nvia letters, emails and postcards and approximately 2,500 business owners, residents,\nusers of the recreation area and concerned citizens signed two petitions opposing the\nconstruction of the CDF, 15 local businesses and approximately 700 Red Hook\nresidents located in close proximity to the proposed location of the CDF expressed\nsupport for the construction of the CDF via letters and emails.\nComment #109: A commenter opined that since GBX is located in an industrial section\nzoned M-3, an active marine terminal, next to the largest barge port in the region,\nexpanding the industrial base by constructing a CDF here is a perfect fit for Red Hook.\nTwo commenters stated that on-Site management of dredge spoils at the proposed Red\nHook CDF or some other local Site is the most sustainable (less impact on the\nenvironment in terms of the carbon footprint) minimal long-term effect on the\nenvironment and cost-effective solution. Fifteen local commercial entities expressed\nsupport for the CDF, stating that due to a lack of docking space for full-sized ships, the\nCDF would allow the expansion of the GBX terminal, which would increase the docking\ncapacity. A number of other commenters stated that limited industrial space is available\nin Brooklyn; increasing the footprint of the property would allow industrial expansion in\nthe area. Approximately seven hundred Red Hook residents located in close proximity\nto the proposed location of the CDF expressed support for its construction, noting that it\nwould result in the improvement to a local business, provide economic benefits and\ncreate local jobs–things which are important to the community of Red Hook.\nAnother commenter opined that it appears that the concerns about the construction of\nthe CDF were more about “zero expansion of industrial land in Red Hook than whether\nthe project was going to be safe or beneficial to the Red Hook community.” Another\ncommenter suggested that a group opposing the Red Hook CDF pursued a campaign\nof misinformation about the nature and safety of the CDF in an attempt to stop the\nexpansion of industry in the area, thereby negatively impacting a community with a\nsignificant unemployment rate. The commenter notes that not only will the CDF\ngenerate temporary local jobs, but expanding the waterfront property will allow further\nindustrial expansion, which would result in permanent local jobs. According to the\ncommenter, the GBX property owner currently hires Red Houses residents. Allowing\nhis business to expand would result in additional hiring potential.\nV-65\nResponse #109: Disposing of the lesser contaminated sediments dredged from the\nlower portion of the canal at a local CDF would be arguably more sustainable than\ntransporting those sediments off-Site for treatment and disposal.\nComment #110: Approximately 900 parties located in Red Hook, elsewhere in New\nYork State and in other states expressed strong opposition to constructing a CDF in\nRed Hook, expressing health and safety-related concerns, concern about its proximity\nto ball fields and a pool and concern about the fact that the owner of the property has\nbeen assessed fines for environmental violations. One commenter asked how\ncommunity input in the form of votes for and against the proposal to construct the CDF\nat Red Hook will be considered in the remedy selection process.\nResponse #110: With regard to the health and safety concerns, the operation of an on-\nSite stabilization facility would have been designed to comply with all safety and air\nemission standards to protect the workers and local residents. Air monitoring would\nhave been conducted at the facility and along its perimeter. In the unlikely event that\nunacceptable levels of contaminants were detected by the samplers, processing\noperations would have been terminated and measures would have been taken to\nprevent future releases. The stabilized sediments placed into the CDF would not only\nhave not leached, but would have been contained in the CDF. Therefore, the stabilized\nsediments would not have posed a health risk to children playing ball in the ball field or\nusing the pool.\nThe selection of a remedy for Superfund sites is not a direct vote process with the\nalternative with the highest acceptance being selected. The selection of a remedy is\nbased upon nine evaluation criteria–one of which is community acceptance. As was\nnoted in the Proposed Plan, during the comment period, the utilization of a CDF was\none of two disposal options that would be evaluated based upon community input and\nacceptance.\nAs a result of concerns that were expressed by the public about the on-Site stabilization\nof the lesser contaminated sediments and their placement in an on-Site CDF, this\ndisposal option was eliminated from consideration. The lesser contaminated sediments\nwill be stabilized off-Site and will be beneficially used.\nUpland Sources of Contamination\nComment #111: A commenter noted that the Whole Foods property, located along the\n5th Street turning basin, is currently being developed. The commenter asked whether or\nnot the property is a source of contamination to the canal.\nResponse #111: The contamination on the Whole Foods property has been addressed\nby NYSDEC under its Brownfields program. The EPA obtained additional sampling\ndata from Whole Foods, has been in contact with the construction company and has\nreviewed its construction plans. In addition, the EPA independently installed wells on\nthe property and took soil and groundwater samples. The EPA assessed the\nV-66\nimplemented remedy at the Whole Foods site and, in combination with the results of the\ngroundwater sampling, concluded that the Whole Foods site does not constitute a\npotential source for recontamination of the canal\nComment #112: Two commenters asked whether or not the Whole Foods property\nremediation, which included capping, took into account the fact that the property is\nsubject to flooding.\nResponse #112: The EPA assessed the implemented remedy at the Site and concluded\nthat it does not constitute a potential source for recontamination of the canal, regardless\nof the fact that portions of the property are low-lying and have been subject to flooding.\nThe construction plans include the collection and treatment of stormwater runoff.\nComment #113: A commenter asked whether or not NYC requested that the EPA not\ntake over the remediation of the upland facilities.\nResponse #113: By mutual agreement, NYSDEC and the EPA decided that NYSDEC\nwould be responsible for the investigation and remediation of the upland facilities and\nthe EPA would be responsible for the investigation and remediation of the canal itself.\nNYC has not participated in such discussions.\nComment #114: A commenter expressed concern that the EPA is not applying a\ncomprehensive approach to address the upland sources of contamination to the canal.\nResponse #114: To prevent recontamination, the upland sources of hazardous\nsubstances must be controlled. The former MGP facilities are being addressed by\nNational Grid, a PRP for these facilities and the federal Site, under NYSDEC oversight.\nBased on the results of the EPA's RI, additional upland areas were found to have the\npotential to contribute contaminated groundwater to the canal and were referred to\nNYSDEC for investigation and, if necessary, remediation under the State Superfund\nprogram. Remediation schedules for all of these facilities will be coordinated with the\nschedule for the canal remedy. In the unlikely event that a timely and effective state-\nselected remedy is not implemented at any of these facilities, the EPA may implement\nactions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure the protectiveness of the selected remedy.\nCombined Sewer Overflows\nComment #115: A commenter noted that there's a sizable difference between the\nEPA’s and NYCDEP’s position related to the reduction of CSOs. Another commenter\ninquired as to the quantity of CSO reductions needed in the upper canal.\nResponse #115: NYCDEP is currently committed to a number of CSO improvement\nprojects that primarily affect the middle and lower portions of the canal. Together, those\nprojects are projected to reduce annual CSO in the whole canal by 34 percent.\nNYCDEP also plans a sewer separation project in a 96-acre area around Carroll Street\nfor flood control purposes. It is projected that this effort would result in an additional\nV-67\noverall CSO reduction of 5 percent when it is completed in 2022. NYCDEP is also\nundertaking a green infrastructure effort that would result in an estimated 10 percent\nCSO reduction in stormwater discharges to the entire canal over an extended period of\ntime (20-30 years).\nUnder the current projections, two major outfalls in the upper portion of the canal are not\ngoing to be reduced at all. The EPA has determined that CSO solids reductions in the\nupper portion of the canal in the range of 58 to 74 percent are needed to maintain the\nsediment PRGs in the surface sediments after remedy implementation for the protection\nof benthic (sediment-dwelling) organisms and herbivorous birds. Put in a different\nway, every year, there are approximately 54 storm events. Using two in-line retention\ntanks as proposed would capture all but five of those events, which translates to an\nalmost 90 percent reduction in overflow events, based on current analysis. Updated\nanalysis will be done during the remedial design and as part of the contemporaneous\nlong-term control plan (LTCP)18 process.\nComment #116: A commenter noted that although the Proposed Plan details the\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) load reductions that would be achieved through\nthe capture of twice the “first flush,” there are no estimates of reductions in the other\ncontaminants contained in the discharge, such as VOCs, PCBs, pesticides and metals.\nThe commenter suggests that the EPA quantify the reductions in these additional\ncontaminants and analyze whether additional CSO capture may be required to fully\nprotect the remedy from discharges of these toxics.\nResponse #116: The baseline ecological risk assessment (BERA) for the Site\ndocumented a number of contaminants of potential ecological concern (COPECs). The\nBERA concluded that total PAHs and certain metals were risk drivers, accounting for\nthe majority of the unacceptable risk. Based on this, preliminary remediation goals were\ndeveloped for those risk drivers under the assumption that all other COPECs would be\naddressed concurrently with the risk drivers. It is assumed that CSO reductions that\naddress the risk drivers will also address the other COPECs since the contaminants\ngenerally tend to adhere to organic particles and be commingled.\nComment #117: Several commenters asked that the EPA insure that the canal\nremediation also address the CSOs. Several commenters stated that it is important that\nthe remediation of the canal be performed thoroughly and that the canal remains clean\npost-remediation.\nResponse #117: Dredging and capping the contaminated sediments will eliminate the\nmigration of the contaminated sediments and human and ecological exposure to them.\nTo prevent recontamination, the upland sources of hazardous substances, including\ndischarges from three former MGP facilities, CSOs to the canal, other contaminated\nareas along the canal and unpermitted pipes along the canal, must be controlled. The\n18 An LCTP is a phased approach for control of CSOs that requires a permittee to develop and\nsubmit an approvable plan that will ultimately result in compliance with CWA requirements and\nNew York State water quality standards.\nV-68\nselected remedy would control the aforementioned sources so that the canal remains\nclean following the remediation. Post-remediation monitoring will ensure the\neffectiveness of the implemented remedy.\nComment #118: A commenter noted that NYCDEP is not precluded from implementing\nCSO controls beyond what is mandated through the LTCP development process and\nnothing in the CSO order between NYSDEC and NYCDEP diminishes the EPA’s\nauthority under Superfund to address toxics being discharged to the canal and protect\nthe long-term viability of the selected remedy.\nResponse #118: NYC is under order with New York State to achieve the water quality\ngoals of the CWA and must ultimately meet the \"highest attainable use\" per the EPA's\nLTCP guidance. The CERCLA and CWA processes are separate. However, EPA and\nNYSDEC are committed to work together and with NYCDEP throughout the\ndevelopment of the remedial design and the contemporaneous LTCP development\nprocess to ensure that both the Superfund and CWA goals are met in a timely, cost-\neffective manner. The EPA’s remedial design will be informed and refined by the\nresults of additional sampling and modeling and by coordination with NYSDEC and\nNYCDEP as they develop the LTCP, provided that it does not delay the remedial\nprocess. The LTCP, which is due to the State in June 2015, will address, at a minimum,\nthe EPA’s remedial performance goals for further CSO solids control in the upper reach\nof the canal.\nComment #119: A commenter asked whether the EPA will take an enforcement action if\nNYC is not willing to address the CSOs to prevent post-remediation recontamination of\nthe canal.\nResponse #119: It is the EPA’s expectation that we will reach a negotiated settlement\nwith NYC, as well as with the other PRPs, to perform the design and construction of the\nremedy selected in the ROD. If the EPA is unable to reach a settlement with any of the\nPRPs, a variety of enforcement options are available under the Superfund law. The\nEPA will take appropriate actions to ensure that the canal cleanup is not jeopardized by\nthe post-remediation recontamination of the canal from the CSOs or other ongoing\nsources of hazardous substances to the canal.\nFrequency of Discharge with Changing Climate Conditions\nComment #120: National Grid and Gowanus Conservancy asserts that the potential\nfrequency and volume of stormwater that may be discharged is uncertain, especially in\nlight of climate change predictions that storm events will be more frequent and severe.\nResponse #120: NYCDEP is a vocal leader in climate change and resiliency planning\nissues, and has included climate change considerations in its overall sustainability\neffort, PlaNYC.19 The New York City Panel on Climate Change was established by\nLocal Law 42 to review scientific data on climate change and its potential impacts and to\nmake recommendations for projections from time to time. In this context, NYCDEP’s\n19 http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml; accessed June 2013.\nV-69\nclimate change reports have consistently warned of the potential for increased future\nrainfall and storm event intensity (see NPCC Report, May 2010).\nThe EPA agrees that prudent planning during the remedial design will require CSO\nreduction levels which give consideration to changing climate conditions in order to\nensure a sustainable CERCLA remedy. Absent this, the planned CERCLA CSO\nreductions might not meet the level needed to maintain the cleanup in the canal.\nThroughout the EPA’s involvement at the Site, the public has expressed concern that\nNYCDEP is underestimating CSO discharge volumes to the canal. NYCDEP does not\nregularly collect data to track actual CSO discharge volumes. Instead, NYCDEP\nestimates CSO discharges for the Gowanus Canal and other watersheds using\nmodeling. The modeling is based on a range of parameters and data which are\ncalibrated through various studies. See NYCDEP, 2008 and NYCDEP, 2007.\nThe WWFP utilized an annual rainfall value of 40.7 inches. This figure was derived\nfrom rainfall data for John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) for the year 1988.\nAlthough total annual rainfall is a consideration, it should be noted that storm duration\nand intensity determine whether a CSO event occurs. NYCDEP modeling estimates the\nbaseline annual CSO discharge volume to be 377 million gallons. After the completion\nof the Flushing Tunnel and pump station upgrades, the estimated annual volume is 250\nMG.\nNYCDEP already plans to determine if adjustments are needed to the rainfall baseline\nas part of the upcoming LTCP process (see Alley Creek LTCP Kickoff Presentation,\nOctober 2012, page 21). Use of a higher figure would arguably be consistent with\nNYCDEP’s June 2013 Climate Risk Information Report (NPCC, 2013), which provides a\ncurrent annual baseline rainfall amount of 50.1 inches (see http://www.nyc.\ngov/html/planyc2030/downloads/pdf/npcc_climate_risk_information_2013_report.pdf).\nNYCDEP’s “Notify NYC – CSO Advisory Notification System” program, begun in\nOctober 2012, includes rainfall data for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) rain gauges at JFK, LaGuardia and Central Park.\nThat figure is roughly 25% higher than the Gowanus Canal CSO modeling baseline, and\nis based on Central Park rainfall data. In addition to JFK and Central Park, NYCDEP\nalso considers data for LaGuardia and Newark Airports (see Alley Creek LTCP Kickoff\nPresentation, October 2012, page 21). Of the four stations considered by NYCDEP,\nJFK is typically the lowest of the four.\nActual annual rainfall levels for JFK since 1988 have been as high as 56 inches in 2011\n(that year Central Park experienced over 72 inches of rain). See Figure 8 and Table 2,\nbelow.\nV-70\nFigure 8: New York City Annual Precipitation\nNYC Annual Precipitation (inches)\nYear Central Park JFK\n1989 65.11 55.73\n1990 60.92 45.24\n1991 45.18 38.73\n1992 43.35 38.38\n1993 44.28 35.61\n1994 47.39 43.33\n1995 40.42 34.42\n1996 56.19 51.45\nV-71\n1997 43.93 39.87\n1998 48.69 37.55\n1999 42.5 40.1\n2000 45.42 41.02\n2001 35.92 32.72\n2002 45.21 43.13\n2003 58.56 44.77\n2004 51.97 50.95\n2005 55.9 49.55\n2006 59.9 44.8\n2007 61.7 46.91\n2008 53.61 46.26\n2009 53.63 45.88\n2010 49.37 42.47\n2011 72.81 55.77\n2012 38.51 39.85\nAverage 50.85 43.52\n1 JFK data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climate Data Center,\navailable: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/ANNUAL/stations/COOP:305803/detail\n2 Central Park data from NOAA, Historical Climatological Data - Central Park, NY, Annual Precipitation\nReport. Available: http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/climate_cms.html\nJFK is located in Queens County. Notably, NYCDEP modeling utilizes JFK 1988 rainfall\ndata not only for the canal, located in Brooklyn, and Newtown Creek, located on the\nborder of Brooklyn and Queens, but also for more distant sewersheds, such as the\nBronx River. See NYCDEP, 2010, page 8-13.\nNYCDEP’s Climate Change Report provides a potential basis for the differential\nbetween the four NOAA stations: “Because some parts of New York City, including\nparts of coastal Brooklyn and Queens, currently experience significantly fewer extreme\nprecipitation days than Central Park, they may experience fewer extreme precipitation\ndays than those shown in the table for Central Park in the future as well.” NPCC 2013,\npage 20. However, it is not clear that this stated differential is applicable to each of the\nseparate sewersheds, including the canal.\nIn addition to any update of the 1988 standard, future impacts need to be considered\nas well. The June 2013 Climate Change report projects a middle range (25th to 75th\nV-72\npercentile) estimate of 0-10% increase in precipitation above the current rainfall\nbaseline during the 2020’s. See NPCC 2013, page 5. Storm intensity is also likely to\nincrease:\nHeavy downpours are very likely to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration.\n“Very likely” is defined as “>90% probability of occurrence. [T]he four years with\nthe most occurrences of 2 or more inches of rain (1983, 1989, 2007, and 2011)\nhave all occurred since 1980. Over the larger Northeast U. S. region, intense\nprecipitation events (defined as the heaviest 1 percent of all daily events) have\nincreased by approximately 70 percent over the period from 1958 to 2011\n(USGCRP, 2013). NPCC, pages 4 and 13.\nThe CSO discharge modeling is also exclusive of extraordinary events which result in\nreleases to the canal. For example, during Superstorm Sandy, approximately 13 million\ngallons of untreated sewage was discharged due to pump stations not being on-line.\nSee NYCDEP presentation to Community Board Six regarding Gowanus Canal\nInfrastructure Improvement/Post-Hurricane Sandy Updates, January 28, 2013, page 4.\nAs a result, there is at least the potential that actual CSO discharge volumes into the\nGowanus Canal may be greater than the current estimate of 377 million gallons per\nyear. In order to achieve the remediation goals, these factors will need to be taken into\naccount during the remedial design for CSO solids controls.\nCriteria for Combined Sewer Overflow Reductions\nComment #121: Community Board Six commented that the separation of the CERCLA\nremedy from the CWA requirements is troubling and it suggested an even more\naggressive approach to CSO controls.\nResponse #121: Sampling data indicate that CSOs are among the sources which are\ndischarging hazardous substances to the canal. If these are not reduced, surface\nsediment concentrations will exceed the PRGs following remedy implementation.\nThese discharges are primarily from RH-034 at the head end of the canal and OH-007\nin the middle of the canal.\nAs discussed elsewhere, in addition to contributing COCs at levels above the PRGs,\nCSO solids also contribute several other deleterious impacts to the selected remedy.\nThe CSO solids adsorb and concentrate other canal contamination which binds to the\norganic sewage components. The CSO solids also decompose, leading to ebullition\nwhich results in transport of NAPL from the sediment to the water column.\nNYCDEP is currently implementing infrastructure repairs and upgrades which will\ndecrease CSO discharges to the lower section of canal and will also reduce the\ndischarge of floatable debris throughout the canal. This work is being done pursuant to\nthe above-noted CSO Consent Order under authority of the CWA. The broad purpose\nof the CSO Consent Order is to achieve the fishable/swimmable goals of the CWA.\nFollowing the completion of the current work, the LTCP process will assess if additional\nCWA-related improvements are necessary. The contaminated CSO solids controls\nV-73\nwhich the EPA is separately requiring are for the purpose of assuring the long-term\neffectiveness of the remedy, rather than for CWA purposes. These additional controls\nwill, however, result in additional CWA benefits.\nThe EPA and NYSDEC recognize the value in coordinating CERCLA and the CWA\nefforts to the extent practicable. In order to ensure that the LTCP process is consistent\nwith the CERCLA remedy, NYSDEC has required that the LTCP must meet, at a\nminimum, the requirements of the Superfund remedy.\nThe LTCP process includes a one-year, post-construction monitoring program to\ndetermine if NYCDEP’s current repairs and upgrades will have achieved the planned\neffectiveness for CWA purposes. The LTCP will then be developed by NYCDEP and\napproved by NYSDEC. The EPA plans to closely review NYCDEP’s monitoring efforts\nboth to assure that the current actions achieve what is planned for the lower canal and\nas a source of information in the remedial design of the contaminated CSO solids\ncontrols selected for the CERCLA remedy. The data developed during the remedial\ndesign, as well as through the LTCP process to the extent that it is moving in parallel,\nwill be utilized to refine the CSO reduction range and the CSO retention tank size\nnecessary to achieve the PRGs.\nCombined Sewer Overflow Controls\nComment #122: A commenter stated that sewage retention tanks would not address the\ncause of the problem–stormwater. Instead of sewage retention tanks, the commenter\nsuggested smaller, strategically-located rain water holding tanks in upslope sites that\nwould make retention tanks unnecessary by diverting overland flow from the sewers.\nNational Grid asserts that high-level sewer separation for some of the largest CSO\noutfalls on the canal will not be adequate to control CSO discharges.\nResponse #122: The WWFP evaluated numerous CSO control strategies including, but\nnot limited to sewer separation, treatment, storage, and combinations of these\nstrategies. While all of these approaches were found to be feasible by NYCDEP,\nNYCDEP screened out all of the options based on cost effectiveness, a factor to which\nthe CWA gives higher import than CERCLA, which requires protectiveness to be\nconsidered first. In order to understand how NYCDEP calculated its CSO retention tank\ncosts and determined that such tanks were not cost effective, the EPA requested\nNYCDEP’s supporting documents for its CSO retention tanks costs from the WWFP.\nNYCDEP did not provide any documentary support for its costs (New York City\nResponse to the EPA Request for Information, November 21, 2012). It should be\nnoted that the costs in the WWFP exceeded the as-built cost per million gallons of other\nretention tanks previously constructed by NYCDEP.\nDuring 2012, NYCDEP and the EPA each performed separate screenings and\nevaluations of technologies for CSO solids controls. NYCDEP’s analysis was\nperformed at the request of NYSDEC under the CWA. NYSDEC specified eight\noptions for NYCDEP to evaluate, including use of silt curtains at RH-034, developing\nmaintenance dredging metrics, upgrades and improved maintenance of the OH-007\nV-74\nweir, yearly monitoring of solids, advanced implementation of NYCDEP’s required CSO\nsediment mound dredging, and additional regular sewer cleaning. NYCDEP concluded\nthat optimizing the OH-007 weir, already done in March 2012, was feasible. NYCDEP\nfound three options – routine cleaning of the OH-007 weir, monitoring solids and\nmaintenance dredging - to have some potential effectiveness. NYCDEP found the\nremaining options to not be feasible.\nThe feasibility analysis performed by the EPA evaluated the same contaminated CSO\nsolids control options as NYCDEP and included the additional option of providing\nretention tanks. The no-action case in the screening analysis performed by the EPA\nwas based on NYCDEP’s WWFP and the controls it plans to achieve - an overall 34%\nestimated reduction of CSO discharges (when compared to NYCDEP’s modeled\nbaseline assumption, and subject to post-construction confirmation). While the CSO\nreductions from NYCDEP’s current repair and upgrade work are calculated with respect\nto the canal as a whole, these reductions will, in fact, only occur for the middle and\nlower reaches of the canal.\nLike NYCDEP’s WWFP, the EPA’s analyses concluded that contaminated CSO solids\ncontrols are feasible in the canal. The EPA concluded that storage in below-ground\ntanks or other structures would achieve much higher levels of CSO reductions than the\nother options considered by NYCDEP’s report. The EPA’s analysis concluded that such\ntanks could be implemented at a fraction of the cost specified in the WWFP, at costs\nconsistent with other CSO tanks constructed by NYCDEP.\nThe NYCDEP intends to implement two projects beyond its WWFP. The contribution of\nthese will be taken into consideration, along with other information developed during\nremedial design, in determining the final tank sizes and costs.\nThe first, to be completed by 2022, is for high-level sewer separation along 3rd Avenue\nin the vicinity of Carroll Street to reduce flooding. It may also reduce CSO discharges to\nthe canal by an additional 5%. However, the storm sewers would discharge runoff\ndirectly from the streets to the canal at Carroll Street with potentially no capture of the\nsolids in the runoff. Contaminant load reduction will likely be less than 5%, and may be\nunchanged if no solids are captured. As with discharge points from new development\nalong the canal, the EPA plans to seek to have appropriate solids and contaminant\ncapture technology implemented at the outfall in order to reduce loading to the canal.\nNYCDEP also has a green infrastructure implementation plan over the coming 20 years\nthat NYCDEP expects will further reduce runoff entering the combined sewers and, and\nreduce CSOs to the canal by an additional five percent. The EPA supports the efforts\nbeing made by NYCDEP in green infrastructure and other source controls which may be\nincluded in the LTCP. However, details about the full range of future green\ninfrastructure projects in the Gowanus Canal drainage area are not known and the\ndegree of CSO solids reductions has not been established. It should also be noted that\nNYCDEP’s green infrastructure plan will be scaled up over time, such that the bulk of\nthe CSO reductions will occur later in the 20-year planning period. See “New York City\nGreen Infrastructure 2012 Annual Report,” April 2013, page 14.\nV-75\nDetailed Calculations on Combined Sewer Overflow Reduction Benefits\nComment #123: Community Board Six suggested that since remedy success is\ndependent on the implementation of CSO controls, the ROD should clearly show how a\nreduction in volume and toxicity from the CSO discharges will be achieved. The Board\nalso suggested that the ROD present clear calculations on the future projected volume\nof contaminants entering the canal, address the uncertainty associated with the\n“presumed” future scenarios and provide estimates of contaminant loading under\ninterim and long-term sediment control measures.\nResponse #123: As noted previously, the EPA developed alternatives and provided cost\nestimates for both the canal remedy and the anticipated contaminated CSO solids\ncontrols in the FS report and FS report addendum. The anticipated benefit of the\ncontaminated CSO solids controls is that they will result in achieving the RAOs for canal\nsediments and the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the implemented\nremedy. The EPA believes that the proposed contaminated CSO solids controls are\nconsistent with the EPA policy and that no additional level of calculations of CSO\nreduction benefits is needed.\nThe following section from the EPA’s 2005 Contaminated Sediment Remediation\nGuidance for Hazardous Waste Sites indicates the following concerning uncertainty in\ndecisions:\nNo two sites are identical and therefore the risk-management strategy will vary\nfrom site to site. . . The strategy selected should be one that actually reduces\noverall risk, not merely transfers the risk to another site or another affected\npopulation. The decision process necessary to arrive at an optimal management\nstrategy is complex and likely to involve numerous site-specific considerations. . .\nManagement decisions must be made, even when information is imperfect.\nThere are uncertainties associated with every decision that need to be weighed,\nevaluated, and communicated to affected parties. Imperfect knowledge must not\nbecome an excuse for not making a decision.\nAs noted previously, during the remedial design, additional information will be\ndeveloped in order to optimize the CSO solids controls to achieve the appropriate level\nof CSO reduction. As discussed elsewhere, the EPA intends to require that\nconsideration be given to future development impacts in designing the appropriate level\nof control.\nNYCDEP has taken the position that the work currently being implemented will result in\nminimum compliance with the SD water body classification for the canal. As a result,\nNYCDEP believes that no further investment will be needed for CWA purposes at the\ncanal. However, additional conditions in the canal are considered to be in violation of\napplicable standards, such as the “narrative criteria” standards. In addition, the goal of\nthe CWA is to achieve fishable, swimmable waters. Even if full compliance with this\nstandard cannot be achieved, the intent of the statute is to obtain the maximum degree\nof progress toward this goal.\nAs noted previously, NYSDEC has already determined that NYCDEP’s LTCP for the\nGowanus Canal must, at minimum, comply with the CSO-related remedial requirements\nV-76\nfor the CERCLA remedy (see NYSDEC’s Proposed Plan concurrence letter, December\n21, 2012). The State’s determination in this regard indicates that the State believes that\nthere are sufficient benefits under the CWA to justify the additional contaminated CSO\nsolids controls in the selected remedy.\nAlthough not considered for CERCLA purposes, the additional contaminated CSO\nsolids controls in the selected remedy will produce CWA benefits, including reduced\nexposure to pathogens and improvement to dissolved oxygen levels.\nIndustrial Sources to Combined Sewer Overflow\nComment #124: National Grid notes that to adequately control the inflow of sediments\nand contaminants from the CSOs and stormwater discharges, other industrial sources\nneed to be identified and controlled.\nResponse #124: NYCDEP, like most municipalities, has historically allowed and\ncontinues to allow industrial discharges to its sanitary and combined sewer systems.\nCSO events, however, may result in the discharge of sanitary sewage and hazardous\nsubstances disposed of by non-regulated users or picked up from captured stormwater.\nSome of these hazardous substances tend to bind to the organic solids present in the\nsewage.\nNYCDEP has operated an Industrial Pre-treatment Program (IPP), as required by\nfederal regulations, since 1987 in order to help protect the sewers, the wastewater\ntreatment plants and NYC's receiving waters. As part of the IPP, NYCDEP issues\npermits for and inspects IPP facilities to control the quantity and quality of the industrial\nwastewater discharged to it its system. In addition to issuing permits, as part of its\nwater and sewer rates, NYC charges for such disposal through the sewers. Ultimately,\nNYCDEP is responsible for the industrial wastewater discharged to its system.\nNYCDEP is also responsible for the lack of treatment which occurs when the industrial\ndischarges are directed to the canal via CSO events.\nThe EPA’s evaluation of CSO solids and its subsequent determination of the need of\ncontaminated CSO solids controls is based on the CSO solids characteristics under\ncurrent combined flow conditions (industrial discharges and other flows to NYCDEP’s\nsewer system) based on data collected in CSOs discharging to the Canal that is\ndocumented in the EPA’s RI report.\nTiming of Combined Sewer Overflow Reductions and Remedy Implementation\nComment #125: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA should:\n Wait for the implementation of permanent CSO controls until the currently\nplanned infrastructure upgrades for the mid and lower reaches of the canal are\ncompleted.\n Evaluate permanent CSO controls as part of the CSO LTCP process.\nV-77\n Not require any permanent CSO controls to be implemented prior to the\ncommencement of the canal sediment remedy.\nResponse #125: The EPA recognizes the importance of timing the implementation of all\nsource controls relative to the implementation of the CERCLA remedy for the canal in\norder to prevent recontamination of the canal. To that end, the EPA has developed a\nschedule for the CERCLA remedy implementation that integrates the timing of the\nrequired source controls, including the former MGP facilities, CSOs and other sources\nidentified along the canal.\nWhile the EPA’s preference is to have the contaminated CSO solids controls\nimplemented in conjunction with dredging the upper and middle reaches of the canal,\ninterim control measures may be necessary. The cost of implementing any interim\ncontrol measures will need to be assessed against the value of accelerating the final\ncontrol measures.\nThe EPA is committed to working closely with NYSDEC and other parties, including\nNYCDEP and National Grid, to fully integrate the source control work with the\nimplementation schedule of the remedy for the canal. The remedial design will also be\ninformed by, but not dictated by, NYCDEP’s work in developing the LTCP for\nsubmission in June 2015 pursuant to NYCDEP’s Consent Order with the NYSDEC.\nThe LTCP will serve as an assessment of CWA progress.\nCharacteristics of Combined Sewer Overflow Solids\nComment #126: A number of comments were received that related to the impacts of\nCSO solids on sediment quality in the canal. NYCDEP argued that CSO solids are not\ncontaminated to a level that requires action under CERCLA or constitute only a small\nportion of the total mass of solids deposited in the canal, while other commenters\nargued that CSOs have a major impact on sediment quality and will require more than\nthe 58 to 74 percent solids reduction, specified in the Proposed Plan, to prevent\nrecontamination of the canal after the sediment remedy is implemented. Specifically,\nthe commenters stated that:\n Total PAH and total PCB concentrations of CSO solids do not exceed the PRGs\n(NYCDEP).\n The lines of evidence related to CSO impacts provided in EPA’s FS report\naddendum are not valid (NYCDEP).\n The recently accumulated sediments adjacent to CSO outfalls are contaminated by\nPAHs, PCBs, pesticides, metals, pathogens, pharmaceutical and personal care\nproducts (PPCPs), and other chemicals that pose a risk to human health and the\nenvironment and threaten the success of any remedy (National Grid).\nResponse #126: Contamination or recontamination of sediments by CSO and\nstormwater discharges has been documented at a number of sites (e.g., ASTSWMO,\n2013; AWTA, 2002; Cohen, 2013; Stern, 2013; Dalton and Fuglevand, 2013). In 2011,\nNYCDEP performed the dredging and capping of contaminated CSO sediments in the\nV-78\nHendrix Street Canal (see Mahoney et al. CSO Sediment Removal in an Urban\nTributary, 2011). Although this is a non-industrial canal on Jamaica Bay, the 7,000-foot\nlong canal is similar in that the uppermost 1,400 feet near a major outfall have a\ncontaminated CSO mound which is causing odor problems. Cadmium, total DDT, total\nchlordane and total PCBs were the primary contaminants of concern (COCs) detected\nin the sediment relative to their respective NYSDEC Technical & Operational Guidance\nSeries (TOGS) 5. 1. 9 screening values for Class C sediment. Additional metals\n(copper, lead and mercury) and dieldrin were detected above TOGS screening values\nfor Class C sediment. Arsenic and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were\nalso frequently detected above TOGS 5. 1. 9 screening values for Class B sediment.\nTotal benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) were detected above TOGS\n5. 1. 9 screening value for Class B sediment in one of twenty samples collected. The\ndetection of benzene was below TOGS 5. 1. 9 screening values for Class A sediment.\nThe EPA’s investigations have established that CSO solids and associated\ncontaminants accumulate in the canal and contribute to unacceptable risks that require\naction under CERCLA.\nSolids and associated contaminants discharged by CSOs pose a risk of accumulating in\nand recontaminating the canal because of the highly urbanized nature of the watershed;\nthe percentage of the watershed served by combined sewers and storm drains (94\npercent); the large annual discharges from CSO outfalls RH-034 and OH-007 and\nincomplete flushing of CSO solids from the canal that are expected to occur even after\nthe improvements currently being implemented under NYC’s Waterbody/Watershed\nFacility Plan (WWFP) (Facility Plan; NYCDEP, 2008) are completed. The EPA has\nreviewed the newly-collected data and information related to CSO solids provided by\nNYCDEP and National Grid in their comments on the Proposed Plan and has concluded\nthat, overall, the results confirm the data and information used by the EPA to develop\nand select the remedy for the canal. In particular, all of NYCDEP’s data confirms that\nthe CSOs contribute CERCLA hazardous substances to the canal. NYCDEP’s\ncomments emphasize the need to control non-CSO discharges, such as from\nunpermitted pipes. The EPA’s conclusion regarding the need to control CSO\ndischarges, however, is consistent with the WWFP’s findings that the CSOs are the\nlargest source of pollutants by volume to the canal. Therefore, CSO reductions are a\nrequired component of the remedy for the canal.\nComment #127: NYCDEP commented that the contaminant concentrations on CSO\nsolids are below PRGs.\nResponse #127: NYCDEP collected wet weather CSO samples from the four major\noutfalls contributing 95 percent of the annual CSO discharge (RH-034, RH-035, RH-031\nand OH-007).20 Samples were collected in six wet weather events as time-composited\nwhole water samples between September 2012 and January 2013. The whole water\nsamples were subsequently filtered using a 0.7 µm filter and the dissolved (<0.7 µm)\n20 Dry weather samples and wastewater treatment plant samples were also collected.\nV-79\nand particulate (>0.7 µm) fractions were analyzed separately. NYCDEP provided the\nEPA with unvalidated data tables,21 and the EPA converted the particulate sample\nresults to CSO solids concentrations using the total suspended solids (TSS) results.\nIt should be noted that particle size distributions in CSO and stormwater samples are\ncontinuous and that the selection of a specific filter size to separate “particulate” and\n“dissolved” phase contamination is an arbitrary operational definition. Some particles\nwill pass through a 0.7 µm filter and will be misclassified as dissolved. In particular, the\ncolloidal fraction of the solids load (and associated contaminants) will pass through a\n0.7 µm filter, but these particles may ultimately be deposited with the rest of the solids\non the sediment bed in the canal. Therefore, the fraction that is classified as “dissolved”\nshould not be excluded as a component of the overall contaminant load to the canal.\nComment #128: NYCDEP commented that the average total PAH concentration on the\nCSO solids based on its 2012 data set for the particulate fraction (30 mg/kg) is\nsignificantly lower than the EPA’s estimate (61 mg/kg).\nResponse #128: Comparing average concentrations (and confidence limits) does not\ntake into account the variability in contaminant concentrations in CSO discharges over\ntime. The long-term average PAH concentration on CSO solids cannot be reliably\ndetermined from these data sets. Only the ranges of total PAH concentrations on CSO\nsolids from the EPA and NYCDEP data sets are compared in Table 3, below, because\nthe sample numbers are not large enough for a robust statistical comparison. In\ngeneral, the EPA sought to address the uncertainty associated with a given sampling\nset by utilizing multiple lines of evidence relating to the hazardous substance\ncontaminant loadings and impacts of CSO solids.\nTable 3: Total PAH Concentrations on CSO Solids from the Four Major CSO\nOutfalls\nTotal PAH17* (mg/kg)\nNumber of\nData Set Sample Type\nSamples\nMinimum Maximum\nEPA 2010 Whole Water\n7 4 185\nGrab\nNYC 2012 Particulate (> 0.7\nµm) 12 18 44\nTime-composited\n* Sum of detected 16 Priority Pollutant PAHs and 2-methylnaphthalene\nNYCDEP’s results are within the range of the EPA’s estimated concentrations, and\npresumably, are less variable because they are based on time-composited samples.\nThe data collectively indicate that PAHs are present in CSO discharges at levels that\n21 Many of the unvalidated PAH and PCB sample results were flagged “B” indicating that the\nassociated blank sample contained an unspecified level of contamination.\nV-80\ncould lead to the recontamination of surface sediments in the canal to levels that\nexceed the PRG of 20 mg/kg at 6 percent TOC.\nAdditionally, NYCDEP calculated the average total PAH concentration on CSO solids\non an organic carbon-normalized basis (30 mg/kg at 40 percent TOC, which is\nequivalent to 5 mg/kg at 6 percent TOC), compared the result to the PRG (20 mg/kg at\n6 percent TOC) and concluded that PAHs on CSO solids are not a concern. However,\nthe concern is that the PAHs discharged in CSOs will accumulate in canal sediments to\nlevels that pose a risk to aquatic organisms. The PAHs and organic carbon in the\nCSOs are subjected to a variety of weathering and degradation processes after they are\ndeposited on the sediment bed, so their composition and relative concentrations in\nsurface sediment will not be the same as they are in the CSO solids. Benthic\norganisms are exposed to the contaminants after they have been incorporated into the\nsurface sediments, so the PRG is compared to the total PAH concentrations on an\norganic-carbon normalized basis in the surface sediment, not the CSO solids.\nComment #129: NYCDEP commented that the average total PCB congener\nconcentration on CSO solids based on the 2012 particulate samples (0.44 mg/kg) is\nslightly lower than the PCB PRG (0.48 mg/kg).\nResponse #129: The EPA did not measure PCB congeners in CSO samples. The\nrange of total PCB congener concentrations on CSO solids based on NYCDEP’s data\nset is 0.24 to 0.94 mg/kg, indicating that PCBs are present on CSO solids at levels that\ncould cause recontamination.\nCombined Sewer Overflow Impacts on Sediments in Upper Reach of Canal\nComment #130: NYCDEP questioned the lines of evidence presented in the “Impact of\nCombined Sewer Overflows on Gowanus Canal Sediments,” section of Feasibility Study\nReport Addendum, Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn, New York, December 2012 (hereinafter\n“CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum”).\nResponse #130: The referenced CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum\nexamines the characteristics of the top two feet of sediment in the upper reach of the\ncanal, where the influence of CSO solids on sediment quality is most apparent. The\nEPA believes that the physical and chemical characteristics of the top two feet of\nsediment in the upper reach of the canal are indicative of substantial CSO impacts.\nWhile NYCDEP disagrees in its Proposed Plan comment submissions, as noted in other\nresponses, NYCDEP reports on the Gowanus Canal which predate the Site’s listing on\nthe national priorities list as a Superfund site are consistent with the EPA’s position.\nTotal Organic Carbon Content of Sediments\nComment #131: NYCDEP commented that the surface sediments (0-0.5 feet) in the\nupper reach of the canal are primarily composed of harbor solids because their average\ntotal organic carbon (TOC) content (six percent) is closer to harbor solids (three percent\non average) than CSO solids (40 percent on average based on NYCDEP 2012 CSO\ndata set).\nV-81\nResponse #131: As is noted later in NYCDEP’s comments, TOC is not a conservative\ntracer than can be used to estimate relative contributions of CSO and harbor solids to\nthe surface sediments. NYCDEP’s receiving water quality modeling report for the canal\n(NYCDEP, 2007) describes the breakdown of organic matter in CSO discharges\nthrough the process of diagenesis. After CSO solids settle to the sediment bed, a\nseries of chemical reactions occur that contribute to the conversion and decay of\norganic matter. According to the modeling report, physical indicators that these\nreactions are occurring are strong odors of hydrogen sulfide and sediment mounds at\ndischarge points. NYCDEP notes that both indicators are apparent in Gowanus Canal.\nNYCDEP performed a “peeper” study in 1989 specifically to investigate diagenesis.\nThis study measured gases produced in the anaerobic sediment layer due to the decay\nof settled organic solids; pore water equilibrators, or “peepers,” were deployed in the\nupper mile of the canal where “sediment activity is expected due to the settling of outfall\nsolids” (NYCDEP, 1993). Given the direct evidence of diagenesis, the TOC content in\nthe canal surface sediment would not be expected to reflect directly the TOC content of\nthe CSO solids prior to deposition or a simple ratio of the TOC content of CSO solids\nand harbor solids.\nIn the EPA’s CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum, total PAH concentrations\non CSO solids are compared to concentrations in surface sediment in the upper canal\nwithout adjusting (normalizing) for TOC content. NYCDEP commented that the PAH\nand PCB contamination in the canal surface sediments could not be attributed to CSOs\nif TOC is used to normalize the contaminant concentrations in the CSO solids and\nsediments prior to comparison. However, organic carbon normalization is based on the\nassumption of equilibrium conditions (EPA, 2002), which is not likely to be the case\nwhen contaminated solids in stormwater are mixed with sewage over a short time frame\nduring an overflow event. Organic contaminant data are typically reported on an\norganic carbon normalized basis to evaluate potential bioavailability after equilibrium\nhas been established at the point of exposure (i.e., in the surface sediments). It should\nbe noted that the mass of PAHs or PCBs discharged to the canal in CSOs is the same\nregardless of how the data are reported.\nRelationships Between Contaminant Concentrations in Combined Sewer\nOverflows and Surface Sediments\nComment #132: NYCDEP concluded that surface sediment PAH concentrations in the\nupper canal are substantially higher than concentrations on CSO solids, and, therefore,\nCSOs cannot be responsible for the sediment contamination.\nResponse #132: The PAH concentrations measured in NYCDEP’s 2012 CSO samples\nare within the range measured in surface sediment samples in the upper canal and are\nsignificantly higher than Upper New York Bay and Gowanus Bay reference area\nconcentrations, indicating that the CSOs do contribute to PAH contamination in the\nupper canal. While the EPA agrees that CSO solids are not the only source of PAHs to\nsurface sediments in the upper canal, the CSO contribution of PAHs (and other\nhazardous substances) is significant in mass and volume. As discussed elsewhere, the\nCSO solids contribute other negative impacts to the sediment, including acting as a sink\nV-82\nby adsorbing other contaminants and transporting NAPL through ebullition caused by\ndecay of the sewage. NYCDEP’s current comments and prior submissions\nacknowledge this adsorptive nature of sediment particles with regard to the fate and\ntransport of sediments. See NYCDEP Proposed Plan comment #3.1, page 20, and\nNYCDEP, 2011, pages 29-34.\nComment #133: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA’s assumption that whole water\nconcentrations of all PAHs are entirely particle-bound is incorrect.\nResponse #133: The PAH concentrations on CSO solids that NYCDEP measured in the\nparticulate (>0. 7 µm) fraction of 2012 CSO samples was within the range estimated by\nthe EPA based on whole water samples. Although the EPA’s estimated PAH\nconcentrations on CSO solids are more variable than NYCDEP’s, the new data do not\ninvalidate the EPA’s interpretation of the data. The EPA recognizes that 100 percent of\nthe contamination is not particle bound; however, the literature related to the distribution\nof PAHs and metals on various particle size fractions in stormwater and urban runoff\nindicates that this simplifying assumption is reasonable (Brown et al., 2012; Grant et al.,\n2003; Hwang and Foster, 2005; DeGroot and Weiss, 2008; Bathi et al., 2012). As noted\nabove, the fraction that is classified as “dissolved” (i.e., <0. 7 µm) also includes the\ncolloidal fraction, which should not be excluded as a component of the overall\ncontaminant load to the canal. It should be noted that in a presentation to the EPA in\nFebruary 2011, NYCDEP used the EPA’s CSO whole water data to evaluate potential\nhuman health risks (NYCDEP, 2011), also making the assumption, at that time, that all\nof the contamination was particle-bound and associated with the TSS; NYCDEP’s\ntreatment of this data utilized the same simplifying assumption as the EPA--that all of\nthe contamination is particle-bound.\nComment #134: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA’s CSO data set is limited and,\napparently, not representative.\nResponse #134: The total PAH, copper and lead concentrations on CSO solids as\nestimated by the EPA (based on whole water samples) and NYCDEP (based on the\nanalysis of the particulate samples) show the same pattern – the ranges of\nconcentrations measured by NYCDEP fall within the range estimated by the EPA, and\nNYCDEP’s data are less variable. The EPA believes that the data collected is, together\nwith the many other multiple lines of evidence considered, including NYCDEP’s CWA\nreports and CSO sampling data, provide strong support for the Agency’s conclusions\nregarding the impacts of CSOs on canal sediment quality.\nComment #135: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA’s comparison of PAH concentrations in\nCSO solids and surface sediments in the upper canal excluded surface sediment data\ncollected on four transects by the EPA’s Environmental Response Team (ERT),22 which\naveraged approximately 950 mg/kg.\nResponse #135: The surface sediment (0-0.5 foot) samples collected by ERT in the\nupper reach of the canal were reviewed by the EPA as part of the RI. The EPA\ndetermined that the ERT data was not appropriate for use in the surface sediment data\n22 The ERT collected supplemental samples during the RI.\nV-83\nset since the samples were collected using vibracore sampling technology. The tops of\ncores taken in soft, very wet and unconsolidated sediments typically do not remain\nintact when the core is placed in a horizontal position for sub-sampling (i.e., the soft\nsediment at the top of the core tends to slump). The surface sediment samples utilized\nin the RI were collected with a grab sampler, and acceptability criteria were applied to\nensure that the top six inches of the grab were representative of surface sediments.\nFinally, although NYCDEP reported that the average PAH concentration in the surface\nsediment intervals from the ERT cores collected along four transects was 950 mg/kg,\nthe average and median total PAH concentrations in these ten samples were 386 mg/kg\nand 153 mg/kg, respectively. Even if one were to assume that NYCDEP was correct in\nasserting that the EPA data effectively understated the PAH concentrations in surface\nsediments, this would result in a corresponding understatement of the risk presented by\nexposure to the PAHs in those surface sediments.\nComment #136: NYCDEP asserts that an average total PAH concentration of 56 + 40\nmg/kg is not representative of surface sediment in the upper canal because it is less\nthan the average total PAH concentration measured in the samples collected by ERT\nand the average concentration in samples collected by NYCDEP for toxicity testing.\nResponse #136: As noted above, the 0-0.5 foot samples collected by ERT were not\nincluded in the surface sediment data set because they were collected with a vibracore,\nwhich adversely affects surface sample integrity. NYCDEP collected only three\nsamples from the upper canal for toxicity testing, and two of these locations are\nadjacent to each other. The EPA’s average concentration was based on samples\ncollected from ten locations throughout the upper reach. National Grid collected three\nadditional rounds of surface sediment samples from the same ten locations in January-\nFebruary 2011, August 2011 and May 2012 (GEI, 2011, 2012a and 2012b). There are\nno statistically significant differences in the median total PAH concentrations in the four\nsets of surface sediment samples considered by the EPA.\nComment #137: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA failed to consider other sources of\nPAHs, especially in the middle reach of the canal, that likely impact the upper reach of\nthe canal.\nResponse #137: NYCDEP reports and other data support the EPA’s conclusion that\nCSO solids discharges are a source of PAHs to the canal:\nWet-weather discharges from a combined sewer system contain a mixture of\nsanitary sewage and urban runoff that is significantly stronger in pollutant\nconcentrations than natural runoff. These pollutants include coliform bacteria,\noxygen-demanding materials, suspended and settleable solids, floatables, oil and\ngrease, and others. (NYCDEP, 2008, page 3-32).\nThe EPA agrees that CSOs are not the only source of PAHs in the upper canal;\nhowever, the large volumes associated with CSOs and the migratory effect of Flushing\nTunnel discharges are likely to have a far greater impact on surface sediments in the\nupper canal than the upstream transport of PAHs from the middle reach of the canal\nbecause tidal circulation is weak.\nNYCDEP also suggests that the CSO solids are not the source of PAHs to the surface\nV-84\nsediment largely by seeking to differentiate contaminant concentrations of CSO\nsamples from those of surface sediments. However, the level of PAHs associated with\na given discharge of CSO solids is unlikely to remain unaltered after entering the canal\n(even setting aside statistical effects created by collection methods such as time-\ncomposited samples). NYCDEP’s 1993 hydrodynamic modeling report noted that CSO\nsolids tend to settle within six hours following an overflow event.23 The report further\nnoted that “[Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD)] is the greatest when the solids initially\nsettle and the reactive solids have an immediate impact.”24 The CSO solids begin\ndecomposing. In addition, the CSO solids may begin absorbing other contaminated\nsubstances; NAPL may be transported via ebullition caused by the sediment off-gassing\nand mixing with other contaminated surface sediment may occur, such as by storm\nevent disturbances.\nComment #138: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA did not consider the impact of other\nmetal sources to the canal (such as active junkyards on the canal that have been cited\nfor numerous violations) and the effect of harbor solids in diluting the inputs of metals\ndischarged from the CSOs.\nResponse #138: CSO contributions of metals are well documented, including by\nNYCDEP’s own recent and historic sampling data reports. NYCDEP’s comment\nacknowledges that copper and lead are higher in CSO solids than in reference areas.\nNYCDEP then asserts that “the EPA’s inference that solids from CSO dominate the\nCanal cannot be supported given the significant dilution by harbor solids to explain\ncopper concentrations. . .”\nThe EPA’s finding that CSO solids dominate the canal, particularly the upper canal, is\nbased on multiple lines of evidence, detailed further elsewhere. Moreover, the EPA’s\nfindings are fully consistent with NYCDEP’s own, predominately pre-Superfund listing,\ntechnical findings:\nHistorical discharges by CSOs and stormwater have impacted almost the entire\nCanal bottom, which can be described as “black mayonnaise” - a dark, black\nmaterial containing large amounts of organic matter and a low percentage of\nsolids. This is most predominately observed upstream of Hamilton Avenue.\n(NYCDEP, 2008, page 4-30).\nCSOs dominate the loadings of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total\nsuspended solids (TSS), and total coliform bacteria to Gowanus Canal.\n(NYCDEP, 2008, page 3-27)\n23 Both the data and model results indicate that outfall solids, having the greatest impact in the\nhead of the canal, settle out within about six hours after a storm event occurs. Based on the\nagreement between model results and solids data these settling rates will be applied in\nprojection analyses.” (NYCDEP 1993; Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Task\n4.3B – Gowanus Canal Modeling) at 4-11, 4-20.\n24 (NYCDEP 1993; Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Task 4.3B – Gowanus Canal\nModeling) at 2-18.\nV-85\nDischarges from the single outfall at the Gowanus Pump Station (RH-034)\ndominate the CSO impacts throughout the entire Canal. (NYCDEP, 2008, page\n4-41).\nAs noted in response to a prior comment, NYCDEP’s attempt to directly compare and\ncontrast CSO sampling results with surface sediment sampling results is not technically\nsound, given the variety of physical and chemical alterations which the solids are\nsubject to between the time of discharge to the canal, settling to the sediment bed, and\nfinally sampling as part of a six-inch thick surface layer. For example, surface\nsediments are likely to be impacted by ongoing mixing with older sediments disturbed\nby vessel traffic, storms and other causes of re-suspension.\nRegarding the processes which may alter the CSO solid metals levels after their\ndischarge to the canal, the EPA believes that harbor sediments have relatively little\nimpact on surface sediment concentrations. The harbor sediments have a much\nsmaller metals loading. As the NYCDEP stated in this regard:\nWhen compared to \"natural” sediments in Jamaica Bay, the naturally occurring\nmetals concentrations in the earth's crust and to the same extent the Inner\nHarbor water quality station sediments, CSO mounds and tributaries dominated\nby CSO discharge have much higher sediment metals concentrations (Table 5-\n16). (Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Final Draft Facilities Planning\nReport. July 1993, page 5-32.)\nNext, the lighter harbor solids tend to settle much less than CSO solids, consistent with\nstandard scientific understanding of the issue. As the NYCDEP concluded in 1993,\nconsistent with the EPA’s current position:\nTotal suspended solids are a critical component of the model framework since\nCSO's contribute significant amounts of solids that settle to the bed producing an\noxygen demand in the Canal. Two solids systems are modeled; background and\noutfall. The reason for this is that background solids concentrations are similar\nthroughout the Canal while outfall solids concentrations vary depending on outfall\nlocations. In addition background solids settle slowly while outfall solids settle\nmore quickly thereby having a greater flux to the sediment… Based on settling\ntests performed for this project settling rates for outfall solids of 50 ft/day were\napplied in the model. Background solids were settled at 1 ft/day in accordance\nwith previous model analyses and calibrations done here. (NYCDEP Inner\nHarbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Task 4. 3B – Gowanus Canal Modeling.\nDecember 1993, page 4-11).\nNYCDEP’s most recent modeling report update reached the same conclusion:\nModeling of total suspended solids (TSS) was separated into outfall and\nbackground components to distinguish between the heavier, more-settleable\nsolids discharged from sewers and the lighter, less-settleable solids suspended\nin receiving waters. (NYCDEP Receiving Water Quality Modeling Report –\nVolume 4 – Gowanus Canal. City-Wide Long Term CSO Control Planning\nProject – September 2007, page 4-32.)\nV-86\nDespite these repeated, consistent conclusions, NYCDEP, with respect to Superfund\nmatters in the canal, has taken the contrary position that the majority of sediment load\nat the head of the canal – where the EPA seeks additional CSO solids reductions - are\nfrom the harbor. During technical presentations in March 2012, NYCDEP placed the\nharbor input at 90%. (NYCDEP, March 26, 2012, page 26). In comments submitted in\nMay 2012 to the EPA’s National Remedy Review Board, NYCDEP revised this number\ndownward slightly:\nThus, NYCDEP's analysis shows that under the conservative supposition that all\nthe CSO solids settle in the Canal, only 20 percent of solids accumulating in the\nCanal are from CSOs and the remaining 80 percent are from tidal exchange and\nother sources under current baseline conditions… Even in areas such as the\nhead end (from the bulkhead to Carroll Street) where the FS asserts that all the\nsolids are due to CSOs, City's evaluation shows that less than 20 % of the solids\ncan be attributed to the CSOs. (NYCDEP (2012), National Remedy Review\nBoard [NRRB] comments, page 12).\nNYCDEP has elsewhere repeatedly determined that the sediment accumulation at the\nhead of the canal is from CSO solids and must be dredged:\nGowanus Canal’s limited capacity for exchange produces a stilling effect that\nallows suspended solid materials to settle to the bottom of the waterbody.\nHeavier solids and organic material discharged during wet-weather from CSOs\nand stormwater have created a sediment mound near the head of the Canal.\n(NYCDEP WWFP (2008), page 4-29)\nThe NYCDEP is committed to removing the CSO sediment mound to eliminate\nthe exposure of CSO sediments during low tides. (NYCDEP WWFP (2008),\npage 8-13).\nGowanus Canal’s limited capacity for exchange produces a stilling effect that\nallows suspended solid materials to settle to the bottom of the waterbody.\nHeavier solids and organic material discharged during wet-weather from CSOs\nand stormwater have created a sediment mound near the head of the Canal.\nThis mound becomes exposed at some points during low tide, when noxious\nodors are released from the anaerobic decay of the highly organic material.\nSimilarly, lighter materials discharged during wet-weather or imported from\nwaters beyond the Canal have settled throughout the Canal. These settled\nmaterials build up over time and need to be removed via periodic dredging to\nmaintain navigable depths throughout the Canal. (NYCDEP, 2008, page 4-29).\nTributary to Upper New York Bay, the estuarine Gowanus Canal system\nexperiences a semi-diurnal tidal cycle varying between 5 and 7 feet. There is no\nfreshwater inflow other than CSO and stormwater discharges during wet weather\nevents. The lack of freshwater inflow created a stilling effect on pollutant\ndischarges that allows heavy organic material and grit to settle to the bottom of\nthe waterbody. A sediment mound that is exposed at low tides has formed at the\nhead end of the canal due to historical CSO discharges. (NYCDEP Receiving\nV-87\nWater Quality Modeling Report – Volume 4 – Gowanus Canal. City-Wide Long\nTerm CSO Control Planning Project – September 2007, page 2-1.\nUsing labile and refractory ratios and decay rates described above total carbon\ndiagenesis was computed and converted to SOD and H2S flux according to\nequations 4-2 and 4-3. Figure 4-5a to 4-5d depicts total carbon diagenesis and\ndissolved oxygen limited SOD computed for the four calibration periods. The\nplots indicate that the upper 500 feet of the Canal are most effected by outfall\nsolids...BOD and solids which respectively exert direct and indirect demand on\noxygen have their greatest impact in the upper reach of the Canal. The data\nindicates that the CSO mound has a significant impact on water quality in the\nupper reach of the canal. (Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Task 4.\n3B – Gowanus Canal Modeling. December 1993, page 4-23, 4-37.)\nThe depth of flow in a combined sewer during normal dry weather conditions is\nquite low. During rain events the combined sewer flows fuller and faster which\nmay flush out any solids that may have settled during dry weather…\nAccumulating sediments are a major problem at the head of Gowanus Canal.\nSeveral feet of sediment have accumulated in the canal during the past several\nyears and each new overflow continues to contribute new sediment. During wet\nweather overflows, sediment particles enter the canal and the coarser grained\nsediments settle to the bottom. Finer grained particles are transported farther\ndownstream. (Inner Harbor CSO Facility Planning Project – Final Draft Facilities\nPlanning Report. July 1993, pages 3-1 to 3-2 and 5-13.)\nNotably, NYCDEP is legally obligated under its NYSDEC administrative order to dredge\nthe CSO sediment mound at the head of the canal. This work, to be conducted at an\nestimated cost ranging from $8.5 - 21.4 million (depending on bulkhead replacement\ncosts), has been attributed by NYCDEP to CSO sedimentation, rather than harbor\nsolids (NYCDEP WWFP (2008), pages 8-5 to 8-6).\nNYCDEP suggests that two active junkyards are additional potential metals sources.\nHowever, NYCDEP provides no data or rationale to support an assertion that these\nactive junkyards are meaningful additional sources of metals to surface sediments in the\nupper reach of the canal, as compared to NYCDEP’s estimate of 377 million gallons per\nmodeled year of CSO discharges. The scrap metal facilities in question are located at\nthe 4th Street basin and immediately north of Hamilton Avenue. The sediment surface\nand coring data for metals do not exhibit a pattern of concentration and diffusion which\nwould be expected if these scrap yards were a source impacting the upper canal reach.\nComment #139: NYCDEP asserts that its analysis of metals data indicates an additional\nsource of lead in the upper canal.\nResponse #139: NYCDEP’s conclusion is based on the comparison of average lead\nconcentrations in CSOs and surface sediments and does not take into account the\nvariability in the data. The ranges of lead concentrations measured in CSOs by the\nV-88\nEPA (74 to 2086 mg/kg) and NYCDEP (127 to 940 mg/kg) overlap with the range\nmeasured in surface sediment in the upper canal (201 to 776 mg/kg, excluding the\nunusually high lead concentration measured in the sample collected near 2nd Street\n[4220 mg/kg]).\nFecal Coliform\nComment #140: NYCDEP asserts that the presence of fecal coliform in the surface\nsediments does not indicate that these sediments are derived exclusively from CSOs.\nResponse#140: The Proposed Plan does not state that sediments in the upper canal\nare derived exclusively from CSOs, but rather that the presence of fecal coliform in the\nupper portion of the canal, where most of the CSOs are located, confirms that the CSO\ndischarges contribute significantly to the formation of the top surface layer of sediment.\nAs noted above, however, NYCDEP’s modeled rate of CSO sediment/harbor sediment\nsettling is at a rate of 50/1, not 20/80, as NYCDEP has suggested since 2012.\nAgain, NYCDEP’s data is consistent with the EPA’s findings. Fecal coliform data for the\nperiod from 1984 to 1998 are presented in NYCDEP’s WWFP (NYCDEP, 2008), which\ndescribes the trend as generally decreasing from the head of the canal downstream\ntoward Gowanus Bay. The fecal coliform data summarized in the CSO Impacts section\nof the FS report addendum confirm this trend. The WWFP also states that for the\nbaseline condition, “CSOs dominate the loadings of . . . total coliform bacteria to\nGowanus Canal . . . CSOs were estimated to contribute 99 percent of the baseline\nload of total and fecal coliform, while stormwater contributes 1 percent.” The high levels\nof fecal coliform measured in surface sediments in the upper reach of the canal are\nvirtually certain to be attributable to CSOs.\nVolume of Solids from Combined Sewer Overflow Discharges\nComment #141: NYCDEP asserts that the net annual sediment volume change in the\nupper canal is estimated to be 675 metric tons of solids per year based on bathymetric\ndifferences between 2003 and 2010. The average CSO solids load to the upper canal\nis estimated at 95 metric tons of solids per year. By inference, the harbor solids are\nlikely the most significant contributor to the net accumulation of solids in the Upper\ncanal.\nIn a related manner, NYCDEP asserts that the EPA fails to acknowledge the uncertainty\nin its bathymetric analysis and interpretation, resulting in insufficient understanding of\nsediment transport:\nFrom sediment transport science, the suggestion that sediments eroded from\nareas near the Flushing Tunnel exit would quickly resettle downstream is without\nmerit. If the water velocity were sufficient to scour the sediments 100 feet or more\nfrom the Tunnel outlet, it would also have been sufficient to distribute those\nsediments throughout the Canal and possibly out to the harbor. Fine grained\nsediments, which constitute the vast majority of surface sediments in the Canal,\nrequire a high shear stress (and high flow velocity) to be re-suspended due to\nV-89\ntheir inter-particle attraction.” (NYCDEP Proposed Plan comment #3.6, page\n29.)\nResponse #141: Even before the canal was constructed, the historical record shows\nthat there was concern that the lack of tidal exchange would result in the canal being a\nstagnant, polluted waterway. The 1849 state legislation which authorized the City of\nBrooklyn to construct, own and operate the canal provided for a basin at the head of the\ncanal, part of a conceptual flushing reservoir and “a sufficient number of self-acting\nflushing gates to keep the said canal clean and healthy...” See Chapter 79 of the Laws\nof 1849, Sections 2 and 3. Despite the known risk, no preventative infrastructure was\nincorporated into the canal as built. By 1877, the canal was declared a nuisance by the\nsame municipal authorities, NYCDEP of Brooklyn, predecessor-in-interest to NYCDEP\nof New York, which oversaw its construction. The next series of “improvements”\nconsisted of adding more sewage lines in order to increase flow. This approach failed\nfor obvious reasons, while contributing sediments which likely still remain in part, given\nthe limited dredging which has occurred historically. (See Hunter Research, Inc. Final\nReport National Register of Historic Places Eligibility Evaluation and Cultural Resources\nAssessment for the Gowanus Canal , Borough of Brooklyn, Kings County, New York in\nConnection with the Proposed Ecosystem Restoration Study. Prepared by Hunter\nResearch, Rabner Associates and Northern Ecological Associates, December 2004.)\nThe Flushing Tunnel, a fairly unique municipal engineering endeavor, was completed in\n1911 for the specific purpose of ameliorating the conditions which directly result from\nthe lack of tidal exchange. The Flushing Tunnel is currently undergoing renovation to\nincrease its flow as part of a project costing approximately $150 million. The next\nphase of this project is the dredging of the upper canal to remove CSO sediments, for\nwhich NYCDEP has submitted permit application documents. The origin of these\nsediments–the CSOs--and the need to remove them has been established in repeated\nNYCDEP reports, submitted to and approved by New York State, since at least 1983\n(see WWFP, pages 5-15 to 5-27). The cost of this dredging is estimated to be $8. 5 -\n21. 4 million, depending on bulkhead replacement costs. (NYCDEP, 2008, pages 8-5 to\n8-6).\nIn addition to CSO solids references cited in Response #138, above, NYCDEP’s\nFebruary 2012 Environmental Dredging Permit Application describes the upper canal\nsediments mounds:\nThe currently proposed DEP dredging project was developed to dredge CSO-\nimpacted sediments; it was not intended to address the more extensive sediment\ncontamination discussed in the USEPA’s RI related to PAHs, PCBs, metals, and\nother toxic contaminants. (NYCDEP, 2012, Environmental Assessment, page 1.)\nThe application acknowledges that CSO-impacted sediments will continue to be a\nproblem:\nShallower dredging would either not remove sediment mounds currently exposed\nat low tide or would result in an earlier recurrence of exposed sediments due to\nongoing CSO discharges. (NYCDEP, 2012, Joint Application, page 7.)\nV-90\nThe application further states that dredging of such CSO sediments is needed from the\nhead of the Gowanus Canal and from several other waterways in NYC:\n[NYCDEP] is required to conduct environmental dredging at several tributaries\nwithin the City of New York to remove combined sewer overflow (CSO) mounds\nthat contribute to nuisance odors and dissolved oxygen deficits at the head end\nof these tributaries. (NYCDEP, 2012, Essential Fish Habitat Assessment\nCitywide Dredging Engineering Design Contract Services, page 1.)\nNYCDEP’s June 2013 PlaNYC Progress Report (NYCDEP (2013), page 64) reports on\nprogress on CSO dredging at the canal and the other CSO-impacted waterways.\nSimilarly, the NYCDEP Commissioner’s July 12, 2013 and August 5, 2013 letters to\nNYSDEC identifies the canal sediment mound work as the “CSO dredge project” in\nproviding an updated status regarding its progress and NYCDEP’s desire to avoid\nunnecessary costs and interference with the anticipated CERCLA dredging.\nNYCDEP’s position, that “deposition on the post-remediation cap surface will be\ncomprised of solids from a number of sources, with the majority coming from Upper\nNew York Bay, as is now the case via tidal action” (NYCDEP 2012, NRRB, page 4) not\nonly contradicts facts first established in the mid-1800s, but would show that NYCDEP\nis currently expending almost $200 million to resolve a problem – lack of tidal exchange\n– which its public comments state does not exist.\nAddressing NYCDEP’s assertions more specifically, the two mass estimates derived by\nNYCDEP are not directly comparable. The mass estimate based on bathymetric\ndifferences between 2003 and 2010 is based on direct field measurements. The mass\nestimate based on the average CSO solids load to the canal is based on a water quality\nmodel that was not calibrated or validated for suspended solids (NYCDEP, 2007).\nAdditionally, the modeled annual CSO discharge to the upper canal used in NYCDEP’s\ncalculations (95 metric tons) represents a “baseline” condition rather than current\nconditions. The “baseline” condition is described in the canal WWFP report as\n“generally [representing] the current state of the watershed and sewer system, with\ncertain exceptions specifically used for planning purposes” (NYCDEP, 2008). The\nbaseline condition was determined using numerical models of the watershed and sewer\nsystems, with separate models for the Red Hook and Owl’s Head Wastewater Pollution\nControl Plant service areas. The baseline condition is based on a design\nmeteorological condition (calendar year 1988), and the exceptions used for planning\npurposes are described by NYCDEP as assuming an estimated future sanitary flow for\nthe year 2045, past wastewater treatment and pumping capacities, and sedimentation\nlevels in sewers associated with reasonable maintenance. An unspecified level of\nuncertainty is associated with each of the parameters used in the models to determine\nthe baseline condition. NYCDEP does not discuss the uncertainty associated with its\nestimate of the annual CSO solids load for the baseline condition, and it is not known\nwhether NYCDEP’s TSS annual load calculations to the canal are a reasonable\napproximation of current conditions.\nNYCDEP’s conclusion that harbor solids are likely the most significant contributor to the\nnet accumulation of solids in the upper canal is contrary to the data and assumptions\nV-91\nused as the basis for the water quality model developed for the Inner Harbor CSO\nFacility Planning Project and subsequent WWFP. The 1993 modeling report (NYCDEP,\n1993) states:\nTotal suspended solids are a critical component of the modeling framework since\nCSOs contribute significant amounts of solids that settle to the bed producing an\noxygen demand in the canal. Two solids systems are modeled: background and\noutfall. The reason for this is that background solids concentrations are similar\nthroughout the canal while outfall solids concentrations vary depending on outfall\nlocations. In addition background solids settle slowly while outfall solids settle\nmore quickly thereby having a greater flux to the sediment.\nThe 2007 modeling report compares water quality conditions before and after\nreactivation of the Flushing Tunnel in 1999 (NYCDEP, 2007). While noting\nimprovements in bacteria and dissolved oxygen levels, changes in sedimentation\npatterns were either not evaluated or not reported. The reintroduction of Flushing\nTunnel flow (with suspended sediment from the harbor) apparently did not affect\nNYCDEP’s assessment of impacts from CSO solids or modeling of TSS impacts:\nIn summary, CSOs and stormwater discharges are primary causes of periodic\nwaterbody use impairments. Discharges of TSS, BOD, settleable solids, and\nfloatables induce nuisance conditions in the upper reaches of the canal and to a\nlesser extent near the mouth of the canal. These nuisance conditions include\nodors and depressed dissolved oxygen in the water column that reaches anoxic\nconditions in summertime due to BOD and sediment oxygen demand, which is\nsustained by CSO settleable solids discharges.\nThe updated model separated TSS into outfall and background components “to\ndistinguish between the heavier, more-settleable solids discharged from sewers and the\nlighter, less settleable solids suspended in receiving waters. A constant settling rate of\n50.0 ft/day was used for sewer-outfall solids, while a settling rate of 1. 0 ft/day was used\nfor the background (receiving-water) solids.” (NYCDEP, 2007, page 4-32).\nThe disparity in these outfall rates is also relevant to NYCDEP Proposed Plan comment\n#3.6 citation, quoted above. As noted previously, NYCDEP described the surface\nsediments as such:\nHistorical discharges by CSOs and stormwater have impacted almost the entire\nCanal bottom, which can be described as “black mayonnaise” - a dark, black\nmaterial containing large amounts of organic matter and a low percentage of\nsolids. This is most predominately observed upstream of Hamilton Avenue.\n(NYCDEP, 2008, page 4-30).\nThe physical properties of the surface sediments closest to outfall RH-034, which led to\nthe creation of an extensive CSO sediment mound, also dictate that these sediments, if\nre-suspended, would tend to fall out quickly as Flushing Tunnel velocities diminish,\nconsistent with the EPA’s transport analysis.\nIn response to NYSDEC questions regarding sediment transport created by the original\nreactiviation of the Flushing Tunnel, NYCDEP’s 1994 observations on transport\nconditions are generally consistent with the EPA’s analysis:\nV-92\nVelocities anticipated at the Gowanus end of the Flushing Tunnel will be\napproximately 4.0 feet/second. After passing through the inlet/outlet structure,\nwhich increases in width from 12' to 50,' and upon entering the Gowanus Canal\nwhichis 100' wide the velocity of the water coming from the Flushing Tunnel will\ndrop significantly to approximately 1.5 feet/second. Based on observations that a\nvelocity of 3.5 feet/second or greater is required to resuspend deposited solids\n(Tchobanoglous, 1981), it is estimated that only very fine particles from the top 3\nto 5 millimeters of a standard muddy sediment may be resuspended and that the\ndisplacement of any resuspended material can be measured in terms of\nhundreds of feet (i.e., less than 500 feet) downstream before it is redeposited to\nthe bottom.\nThe effects of the resuspension of particles due to the reactivation of the\nFlushing Tunnel would be similar to existing conditions at the head end of the\ncanal due to the existing combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Bathymetric\nsurveys of the head end of the Gowanus Canal indicated that the CSOs cause\nsediment mounding to occur for a maximum distance of approximately 500 feet\ndown the canal. Similarly, any sediment resuspended at the head of Gowanus\nCanal due to the reactivation of the Flushing Tunnel will remain within the head\nend of the canal and most likely resettle to the bottom before reaching the Union\nStreet Bridge. Unlike the irregular discharge from CSOs, the effects of\nresuspension from the reactivation of the Flushing Tunnel will occur only within\nthe first few months of its operation after which time the particles will settle and\nre-establish their location within the head end of the canal. NYCDEP Permit\nApplication documents relating to implementation Inner Harbor CSO Facility\nPlanning Project, page 10, DEP_P_SEW_00065355.pdf\nThat analysis also appears consistent with information set forth in NYCDEP’s dredging\napplication (NYCDEP, 2012). NYCDEP submitted this permit to implement an\nadditional element of the 2008 WWFP. The WWFP called for dredging 750 feet of the\nCSO sediment mound which extends from the RH-034 outfall. NYCDEP’s permit\napplication extended the dredging length to 825 feet based on updated bathymetry data\nfrom the EPA (2010) and NYCDEP (2011). After dredging the upper layer of CSO\nsediments, NYCDEP proposes a clean sand cap to cover the remaining accumulated\ncontaminated canal sediments. To protect against cap scour from the Flushing Tunnel\nand outfall RH-034, NYCDEP’s permit calls for the installation of 200 feet of cabled\nconcrete block mat system. (See NYCDEP, 2012, Joint Application for Permit, page 8).\nThe proposed length of the scour protection system is not inconsistent with the EPA’s\nbathymetric or sediment transport analysis.\nIt should be noted that the WWFP acknowledges that solids associated with CSO\nevents will continue to be discharged to the canal following implementation of the\ncurrent upgrades. In response, the WWFP Modeling Report includes an analysis which\nsuggests that the upgraded Flushing Tunnel will disperse the solids more evenly\nthroughout the canal and into the harbor than in the past:\nWith respect to settleable solids, analyses of the projected sedimentation of\nsettleable solids indicate that a significant reduction in sedimentation and the\nV-93\naccumulation of sediment at the bottom of the canal can be expected, particularly\nfor the areas located near the head of Gowanus Canal (in the vicinity of the RH-\n034 outfall and the outlet of the Gowanus Canal Flushing Tunnel.) The reduction\nof sedimentation can be attributed to a combination of factors. The reduction in\ndischarged CSO volumes will also decrease the amount of settleable solids\ndischarged into the canal. In addition, the flushing action of the upgraded\nGowanus Canal Flushing Tunnel will increase horizontal velocity profiles and will\nthereby help to reduce settling in the canal itself. The resulting transport of solids\nwill result in a more even distribution of settleable solids within the Canal and Bay\nand will also help to transport solids into the open waters beyond the assessment\narea. (NYCDEP, 2007, page 5-19.)\nThe associated figure from this modeling report excerpt depicts a sediment mound,\nunder current modeled conditions, extending 1,000 feet from RH 034:\nThe WWFP similarly states:\nAccording to the modeling analysis, reactivating the Flushing Tunnel would\ndeliver Upper New York Bay water to the Canal and would not only supply higher\ndissolved oxygen concentrations but would also improve the Canal’s assimilative\ncapacity for pollutant discharges by enhancing circulation and exchange with the\nV-94\nGowanus Bay boundary. The artificial circulation would provide for a flushing\naction that would help to minimize sedimentation near the head of the Canal.\n(NYCDEP, 2009, page 4-44.)\nThe suggestion that widespread dispersion of outfall solids will occur, rather than more\nlimited fine particle transport, is inconsistent with the settling rates reported by NYCDEP\nand its 1994 permit application responses to NYSDEC. Nevertheless, in conducting this\nanalysis and describing future operations, the WWFP has effectively memorialized the\nhistoric role of the canal, which is owned and operated by NYC, as an extension of its\nsewer system. The canal, particularly the upper canal, has and will continue to function\nas a sewage retention basin in the absence of additional contaminated CSO solids\ncontrols. In contrast to other typical urban water bodies with CSO discharges, the canal\nis effectively a managed sewage solids disposal unit.\nComment #142: NYCDEP noted that it developed an empirical mass balance based on\nthe enrichment of various chemicals relative to aluminum and assuming that CSOs and\nharbor solids were the only sources of the solids and the chemicals. NYCDEP indicated\nthat none of the hypothetical mixing scenarios could account for the observed\ncontaminant mix in upper canal surface sediments.\nResponse #142: The fact that a mass balance could not account for all of the surface\nsediment contamination in the upper canal is not surprising, given the uncertainty\nassociated with the sample data, the use of averages to represent CSO and harbor\ninputs and the complex and continually changing site conditions (e.g., changes over\ntime in weather conditions, CSO discharge volumes, chemical concentrations in CSO\ndischarges, Flushing Tunnel operations, contributions from other sources, etc.).\nAdditionally, NYCDEP did not provide a full description of the methods that were used\nor a discussion and verification of the assumptions in the underlying methods.\nAgain, NYCDEP’s comments are contrary to its CWA-related reports. The WWFP not\nonly recognized the need to dredge previously discharged CSO sediment mounds, but\nalso the expense of future maintenance dredging for continued solids discharge, in the\nabsence of CSO controls, stating:\nDredging would be conducted as an alternative to structural CSO controls such\nas storage. Bottom water conditions between dredging operations would likely\nnot comply with dissolved oxygen standards and bottom habitat would degrade\nfollowing each dredging. This technology allows CSO settleable solids to exit the\nsewer system and settle in the waterbody generally immediately downstream of\nthe outfall, but without regular or periodic dredging, such mounds can extend a\nthousand feet or more. (NYCDEP, 2008, page 7-25.)\nNYCDEP’s October 2012 Engineering Feasibility Report regarding CSO solids controls,\nsubmitted to the State at NYSDEC’s request, estimated that maintenance dredging,\nfollowing either the planned removal of the CSO mounds or implementation of the\nSuperfund dredging remedy, would cost $4 million every 5 years, while still degrading\nwater quality, as acknowledged above. (NYCDEP, 2012, pages 3 and 14 and Table 1).\nThe EPA believes that directing those funds to capital investment to avoid repeated\nV-95\nmulti-million dollar maintenance costs would produce greater benefits than continued\nuse of the canal as a sewage retention basin.\nRadioisotope Profiles in Sediment Cores\nComment #143: NYCDEP asserts that the radionuclide profiles obtained by National\nGrid do not indicate a high degree of disturbance from CSOs in the canal. Specifically,\nNYCDEP comments that the radionuclide (cesium-137 and lead-210) profiles in cores\ncollected by National Grid in the upper reach of the canal are typical of profiles obtained\nelsewhere in the harbor (i.e., Newark Bay) and, thus, are indicative of typical sediment\naccumulation processes rather than episodic disturbances. NYCDEP contends that the\nlead-210 profiles are not interpretable, because they show no decline over time, similar\nto the lead-210 profiles in cores collected in Newark Bay.\nNYCDEP also comments that the cesium-137 profiles in cores from the upper reach of\nthe canal are indicative of “typical sediment accumulation processes” and do not show\nevidence of CSO-related disturbances.\nResponse #143: The canal infrastructure has been subject to a series of on-going\nchanges. Until 1987, for example, when the Red Hook wastewater treatment plant\n(WWTP) came on-line, dry weather discharge from outfalls in the Red Hook system,\nsuch as RH-034, were continuous, at a rate of at least 15 million gallons per day (MGD),\nwith wet and dry weather discharges totaling 21 MGD. (NYCDEP, 1983, pages 2-9 to\n2-10, 2-32). In a similar manner, a pump station was not installed near OH-007 until\n1990, such that sewage generated in the vicinity of the outfall discharged to the canal.\n(NYCDEP, 2008, page 3-17). In 1999, the Flushing Tunnel was restarted. As a result\nof such infrastructure changes, as well as vessel movement, storms and other re-\nsuspension causes, it is unlikely that ideal profiles would be found consistently. Despite\nthis, the lead-210 profiles in cores collected in the 4th Street and 6th Street turning\nbasins, which are in relatively undisturbed areas of the Gowanus Canal, do resemble\nthe ideal profile of exponential decline with depth (see Figure 6-5b of the Gowanus\nCanal RI report). The nature of a CSO discharge is visually evident after a large storm\n(as seen in the photograph of a CSO discharge in Figure 2 of the CSO Impacts section\nof the FS report addendum) and sand layers indicative of CSO deposition are evident in\nboring logs for sediment cores collected by the EPA and National Grid upstream of the\narea between DeGraw and Douglass Streets. Based on the multiple lines of evidence\navailable, including those discussed above, there can be no serious dispute that the\nCSOs have been an ongoing source of solids and contaminant discharge to the canal\nfrom its construction to the present.\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Composition\nComment #144: The CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum included several\nrepresentative high resolution hydrocarbon fingerprints of sediments from the upper\nreach of the canal and associated interpretations from a 2007 report prepared by\nNewFields for National Grid (NewFields, 2007) to demonstrate that the surface\nsediments were not predominately affected by contamination from the former MGP\nV-96\nfacilities. NYCDEP notes that the NewFields data set is of poor quality because it did\nnot analyze field duplicate, field blank, equipment blank, or trip blank samples.\nResponse #144: The samples were collected by National Grid in accordance with a\nwork plan approved by NYSDEC. Appendix G of “Draft Remedial Investigation\nTechnical Report, Gowanus Canal (GEI, 2007) provides the data usability summary\nreport. Field duplicates and field blanks were analyzed for all chemical constituents\nincluding SVOCs, and trip blanks were analyzed for VOCs. The samples selected for\nforensic analysis were a subset of the core samples collected for the full suite of\nchemical analyses. Although the field quality control samples did not undergo forensic\nanalysis, the SVOC results did not indicate any systematic pattern of contamination\nindicative of improperly cleaned equipment or poor sampling techniques. The EPA’s\nconsideration of the NewFields data set is simply one of multiple lines of evidence.\nComment #145: NYCDEP notes that both NewFields and the EPA arbitrarily selected a\nlimited number of samples to draw their respective conclusions that CSOs contribute\nthe bulk of PAHs to the shallow sediments in the canal.\nResponse #145: The EPA only reviewed the hydrocarbon fingerprints for samples\ncollected from the top two feet of sediment in the upper reach of the canal because this\nsediment layer was the focus of the CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum.\nRepresentative chromatograms indicative of coal tar in the native sediment were\nprovided for comparison only. Additional hydrocarbon fingerprints for shallow\nsediments in the upper reach of the canal that were provided by National Grid in its\ncomments on the Proposed Plan are consistent with the NewFields samples Namely,\nthe PAH mixtures in the samples vary by location, and include both petrogenic and\npyrogenic components. It should be noted that the EPA has placed an equal emphasis\non the need to control major sources. Based on preliminary cost estimates, the total\ncost of the former MGP facility cleanups is estimated to be $500-600 million. The EPA’s\nestimate of the cost of CSO retention tanks is $78 million.\nComment #146: NYCDEP notes that there is an uneven application of the assignment\nof unresolved complex mixture (UCM) to the chromatograms used for illustration\npurposes in the NewFields report.\nResponse #146: Once the baseline begins to rise (which is directly proportional to the\ntemperature of the oven/column during analysis), it does not tend to decrease. Any\nsignal above the highest point of the baseline at the end of the analysis can be\nconsidered part of UCM. Both the chromatograms (reproduced in the CSO Impacts\nsection of the FS report addendum) show the presence of a UCM above the baseline\nrise.\nComment #147: NYCDEP comments that the EPA should not attribute the presence of\npetrogenic (petroleum-based) PAHs in the shallow sediments primarily to urban runoff\nassociated with CSOs.\nResponse #147: In the CSO Impacts section of the FS report addendum, the EPA\nstated that unresolved complex mixtures with multiple sources of PAHs are consistent\nwith impacts from urban runoff in CSO discharges. This is a reasonable conclusion\ngiven the urbanized setting and fact that the entire upper canal is replete with CSO\nV-97\ndischarge points. The Gowanus Canal was listed on New York State’s Section 303(d)\nList of Impaired Waters Requiring a Total Maximum Daily Load in 2007; the listed cause\nof the impairment was “dissolved oxygen/oxygen demand,” and the listed sources of\noxygen demand were urban runoff, storm sewers and CSOs (NYCDEP, 2008). As\nnoted previously, the WWFP also indicates:\nWet-weather discharges from a combined sewer system contain a mixture of\nsanitary sewage and urban runoff that is significantly stronger in pollutant\nconcentrations than natural runoff. These pollutants include coliform bacteria,\noxygen-demanding materials, suspended and settleable solids, floatables, oil and\ngrease, and others. (NYCDEP WWFP (2008), page 3-32).\nComment #148: NYCDEP commented critically on various other data analyses in the\nNewFields report (i.e., diagnostic PAH ratio analysis, mixing model).\nResponse #148: Since the noted data analyses were not reviewed or used by the EPA\nin the development of the FS report addendum or Proposed Plan, these comments will\nnot be addressed here.\nCombined Sewer Overflow Contribute Variety of Hazardous Substances to\nSediment\nComment #149: National Grid commented that the results of sampling that it conducted\nshow that continuing discharges from the CSOs pose an ongoing risk to both human\nhealth and the environment and that the proposed reductions will not eliminate canal\nrecontamination.\nResponse #149: National Grid collected sediment cores from a depth of 0 to 4 feet\nbelow the sediment surface in the vicinity of the CSO outfalls in 2012 and analyzed\nsediment samples for a variety of constituents. The sediment samples contained a\nrange of contaminants, including PAHs, PCBs, metals, pathogens and PPCPs. The\nEPA agrees that the CSOs continue to discharge a variety of chemical and biological\ncontaminants to the canal. The data collected by the EPA and others are sufficient to\nestablish that CSO reductions are necessary to address unacceptable risks and prevent\nrecontamination of the canal after the remedy is implemented. Although pathogens and\nPPCPs were not considered for CERCLA risk assessment purposes, the presence of\nthese constituents indicates that substances discharged by CSOs persist and\naccumulate in canal sediments. The preliminary estimates of CSO solids reductions\nthat were provided in the Proposed Plan (58 to 74 percent) were based on the\ninformation available at the time. These estimates will be refined during remedial\ndesign as additional information is gathered.\nCombined Sewer Overflow Solids\nComment #150: The PRP Group noted that the Proposed Plan did not define the term\n“shallow sediment” in the section titled “Solids Impacts from Combined Sewer\nOverflows.”\nV-98\nResponse #150: “Shallow sediments” in the upper reach of the canal refers to the 0-2\nfoot depth interval. The Proposed Plan reported that a high TOC content of about 6\npercent is evidence that the 0-2 foot interval of sediment in the upper reach of the canal\nis dominated by CSO loading. However, Table 2 reports that soft sediments throughout\nthe canal have a substantially higher TOC average of 11.9 percent as a result of the\ncontribution of NAPL contamination in sediments adjacent to the former MGP facilities.\nComment #151: The PRP Group noted that the Proposed Plan reported that PAH,\ncopper and lead concentrations are similar in surface sediments from the upper reach of\nthe canal and in CSO solids. The commenter notes that aluminum and iron are\nmentioned in this section, but their likely sources are not identified.\nResponse #151: Iron and aluminum are not enriched in canal surface sediments or\nCSO solids relative to sediments from Upper New York Bay and Gowanus Bay (with a\nfew localized exceptions). Therefore, the iron and aluminum in sediments and CSO\nsolids are naturally-occurring components of the mineral matrix. CSO impacts cannot\nbe identified based on analysis of iron and aluminum content alone.\nCombined Sewer Overflow Challenges and Investment\nComment #152: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA’s approach to controlling CSO\ndischarges to the canal does not adequately address the challenges and the investment\nrequired for these controls to be effective. Additional items that NYCDEP suggested\nshould be considered include:\n Ongoing control measures.\n Impacts associated with locating large tanks in a highly urbanized area.\n Complexities of constructing and operating two multi-million gallon CSO retention\ntanks.\nResponse #152: The EPA recognizes the challenges associated with implementing\ncontaminated CSO solids controls in the urbanized canal area and NYCDEP’s\ninvestment in improving water quality through a variety projects, including an upgrade of\nthe Flushing Tunnel. While NYCDEP’s current and planned projects will have a positive\nimpact on water quality, such as dissolved oxygen levels in the canal, these projects will\nhave limited effect on the CSO discharges that settle in the canal. Contaminated CSO\nsolids controls are a critical element in achieving the CERCLA objectives of the remedy\nand ensuring its overall success and sustainability.\nEvaluation of Combined Sewer Overflow Controls\nComment#153: With respect to the CSO controls, NYCDEP asserts that the EPA did\nnot identify the Applicable and Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) for the\nCSO measures evaluated in the FS Addendum Report, and failed to provide a detailed\nevaluation of the alternatives.\nV-99\nResponse #153: In a June 28, 2012 letter to NYCDEP, NYSDEC identified eight\npossible options that might be effective in addressing solids from CSOs and suggested\nthat NYCDEP evaluate them. The eight options were:\n Optimizing existing sedimentation trap at outfall OH-007.\n Improved maintenance program at the outfall OH-007 sediment trap.\n Installation of silt curtains and/or netting facilities at all CSO outfalls discharging to\nthe canal.\n Yearly monitoring of CSO solids deposition in the canal.\n Development of metrics for maintenance dredging of CSO solids in the canal.\n Additional regular sewer cleaning in the drainage area.\n Engineering evaluation of an interim or permanent sedimentation trap at outfall RH-\n034.\n Advance NYCDEP’s dredging of CSO mounds at the head end of the canal to\ncomply with the CSO Order on Consent, while seeking synergetic opportunities to\nadvance the demonstration and development of remedial design protocols for\ndredging, dewatering, disposal, stabilization and capping pursuant to the Superfund\nprogram.\nNYCDEP completed this evaluation (Evaluation of Possible Measures for CSO Solids\nControl, Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, Brooklyn, New York, October 3 2012). In\nparallel, the EPA evaluated possible options identified by NYSDEC and added CSO\nretention tanks. The results of the EPA’s evaluation were presented in the CSO\nImpacts section of the FS report addendum. The evaluation utilized a comparative\nranking system from 1 to 4 (1 being the poorest and 4 being the highest) to identify the\nsource control option that would be most effective. The results of the EPA’s source\ncontrol evaluation were as follows:\n The trap chamber at OH-007 could serve as an auxiliary/temporary CSO measure\nfor OH-007, but not for RH-034 at the head of the canal (effectiveness ranking 2).\n Maintenance dredging will not facilitate CSO solids reduction but is a feasible\ntechnology (effectiveness ranking 2).\n CSO retention tanks will reduce the CSO solids discharged to the canal for both RH-\n034 and OH-007 (effectiveness ranking 4).\nV-100\nBelow-ground retention tanks, the contaminated CSO solids controls presented in the\nFS report addendum and in the Proposed Plan, are an established technology for\ncontrolling CSO discharges. Regarding the siting of these storage facilities, the EPA\nhas made a number of suggestions to NYCDEP that include innovative strategies, such\nas using the Flushing Tunnel for CSO storage or burying CSO storage retention tanks\nunderneath the canal in RTA 1. The EPA’s long-term objective for the canal, following\nthe creation of a clean bottom surface after remedy implementation, is the prevention of\nrecontamination of this clean surface. A recent report by a committee from the EPA and\nstate agencies (ASTSWMO, 2013) noted that “recontamination and source control are\nimportant issues for consideration when planning, remediating and monitoring\ncontaminated sediment sites.” The document further notes “Recontamination and\nsource control are emerging as concerns at a number of contaminated sediment sites\nwhere remediation has been completed.”\nThe EPA believes that the documents which are part of the remedy selection process\nprovided sufficient detail with respect to the contaminated CSO solids controls for\nmeaningful public comment. CSO solids controls were evaluated by multiple reports\nwhich were available as part of the Administrative Record during the comment period,\nincluding the FFWP, NYCDEP’s October 2012 CSO Control Engineering Feasibility\nReport and the FS report addendum and Proposed Plan.\nThe FS report lists the ARARs for the remedy, categorized into three areas: chemical-\nspecific, action specific and location-specific. The EPA believes that the ARARs list\nincorporates all of the necessary regulatory requirements for the range of contaminated\nCSO solids controls considered. It should be noted that CSO solids reduction will result\nin a decrease in discharges which currently occur, as opposed to a new discharge point,\nsuch as water treatment for decanted sediment water, one of various categories listed in\nthe ARARs table. Similarly, a CSO retention tank in particular will result in material\nwhich is currently released to the canal in being handled at a wastewater treatment\nplant under NYCDEP’s standard treatment process. No ARAR evaluation is necessary\nfor sending the sewage to the existing treatment plants for proper handling.\nAlthough the NYCDEP comments do not specify any ARARs (aside from the potential\nalienation of parkland), which should have been considered but were not identified, the\nselected remedy is required to comply with applicable regulations.25 During the remedial\ndesign process, the list of ARARs will be updated as necessary to ensure proper\ncompliance.\nComment #154: NYCDEP asserts that CSO controls were not evaluated using the nine\nNCP criteria for remedy selection.\n25 If it is determined that parkland is affected in a manner which requires regulatory compliance,\nsuch compliance will occur. A determination will be required as to whether work being\nperformed to remediate a NYC-owned property which is part of both state and federal\nSuperfund sites constitutes alienation of parkland.\nV-101\nResponse #154: In the Proposed Plan and ROD, the EPA evaluated the implementation\nof contaminated CSO solids controls in the upper portion of the canal as part of the\noverall remedy using the NCP evaluation criteria.\nUncertainty Regarding Combined Sewer Overflow Volume Reduction Required\nComment #155: NYCDEP expressed concern about the uncertainty related to the CSO\nvolume reduction required.\nResponse #155: The toxicity test data indicate that the surface sediments in the upper\nreach of the canal, which is the reach most heavily influenced by CSO solids, are toxic\nrelative to reference stations in Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay, which\nestablishes the need for remedial action. The CSO sample data collected by the EPA\nand NYCDEP indicate that PAHs are present in CSO discharges at levels that could\nlead to the recontamination of surface sediments to levels that exceed the PRG. The\nCSOs also discharge metals and PCBs to the canal.\nFollowing the implementation of the remedy, the anthropogenic background level of\nPAHs in surface sediment will depend on the level of CSO reductions. Storm sewers\nand direct runoff drain only two percent and six percent, respectively, of the canal\nwatershed and are, therefore, considered minor contributions. See the WWFP. The\ngoal of the contaminated CSO solids controls is to reduce the contribution of CSO solids\nso that the average total PAH concentration in Gowanus Canal surface sediments after\nremediation does not exceed 20 mg/kg.\nThe improvements that are being implemented under NYCDEP’s Gowanus Canal\nWWFP will achieve an overall 34 percent reduction in CSO discharge volume.\nAdditional reductions through limited sewer separation and green infrastructure are\nplanned by NYCDEP to be achieved over time. No CSO reductions are planned by\nNYCDEP for the upper reach of the canal at RH-034; in fact, CSO discharges at RH-\n034 will increase by approximately five percent after the current improvements are\ncompleted. Preliminary estimates of CSO solids reductions needed to the upper and\nmiddle reaches of the canal to meet the RAOs were presented in the FS report\naddendum and range between 58 to 74 percent. Therefore, CSO solids reductions to\nreduce hazardous substance loading, beyond those currently planned by NYCDEP for\nCWA compliance, will be required to meet the objectives of the CERCLA remedy.\nAnnual Combined Sewer Overflow Volume Capture Compliance with Clean Water\nAct and Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy\nComment #156: National Grid and the PRP Group assert that the maximum achievable\nCSO reductions must be achieved before the remedy is implemented. The extent of\nCSO reductions should be carefully evaluated. The commenters also suggested that\nthe EPA consider using the 85% capture of the annual CSO volume as a discharge\nvolume criteria, which is the standard set forth in the EPA’s CSO policy under the CWA.\nThe commenters also noted:\nV-102\n Even if NYCDEP is successful in reaching its estimated reductions as a result of\nits Flushing Tunnel-related upgrades, the CSOs will continue to contribute 66%\nof current loadings into the canal and the remedy will not be sustainable.\n Planned development in the area has the potential to increase sewage flows\nfurther and it is unclear whether such projects have been incorporated into the\nprojected 34% reduction of CSO discharges.\nResponse #156: The 85% volumetric capture metric is applied in the presumptive\napproach to CSO controls in the CSO Control Policy. However, a CSO discharger such\nas NYCDEP may choose to follow the CSO Control Policy’s demonstrative approach to\ncontrols. Ultimately, the discharger is required to not impair fishable/swimmable water\nquality conditions. The conditions which exist in the canal today do not comply with the\nCWA; NYCDEP is implementing improvements as part of the WWFP to move toward\ncompliance. NYCDEP is applying the demonstrative approach with an adaptive\nmanagement component to improve water quality conditions via its CSO Consent Order\nwith the State of New York. However, sediment quality in the canal needs to be\naddressed, as well, in order to achieve the CERCLA objectives for canal sediments and\ncontaminated CSO solids controls are needed to reduce the discharge of CSO solids.\nThe CERCLA objectives are based on avoiding recontamination that would result in\nremedy failure, rather than being based on dissolved oxygen levels for fish populations\nand pathogen levels. While the EPA anticipates that implementation of the required\nCSO solids controls will lead to improved CWA compliance, a separate assessment of\nsuch CWA compliance will be performed by NYCDEP as part of the LTCP process.\nFlooding\nComment #157: NYCDEP stated that the remedy must not exacerbate flooding in the\ncanal, including through impacts of adsorption of NAPL by the active layer of the\nengineered cap.\nResponse #157: In general, flooding within the Gowanus area is highly dominated by\nthe low lying, level topography of the former wetlands area, and its urbanized, highly\nimpervious nature. As a result, the selected remedy will have only marginal impacts.\nImplementation of the selected remedy may provide slight increases in capacity of the\ncanal to handle flooding under certain conditions with restoration of deeper canal levels\nand as a result of restoration of the 1st Street basin. The volume between the bank\nheight and pre-flood water level will provide some extra flood capacity. Providing\ncontaminated CSO solids controls through retention tanks will also help alleviate\nflooding conditions during storms, including the sewage component.\nImpermeable sheet pile barriers were selected in the FS as the representative option for\nbank-stability related bulkhead work along the canal during the implementation of the\nremedy. In areas of low groundwater discharge, impermeable barriers may be effective\nwithout significant groundwater mounding. Bulkheads may be made permeable, where\nappropriate. On clean parcels, sheet piling may have below-grade discharge openings.\nOn contaminated parcels, where needed, treatment gates could be incorporated into the\nV-103\nbulkhead wall design to funnel groundwater through the treatment gate, allowing for\ndischarge of treated groundwater to the canal. In low impact areas, permeable\ntreatment barriers could potentially be used to absorb groundwater impacts before\ndischarge to the canal. These design and other design elements will be considered to\naddress flooding as a result of groundwater mounding.\nStudies conducted by the EPA are being used to assess the potential range of\ngroundwater upwelling velocity into the canal. During the remedial design, the EPA\nplans to utilize DTS or other technologies in a portion of the canal to better understand\nthe characteristics of groundwater upwelling. These data will be used to estimate\ngroundwater discharge locations and rates to the canal. These data will be\nincorporated into the remedial design to reduce the effects of groundwater mounding\nnear the canal from remedy implementation.\nIn its comments, NYCDEP states with respect to upwelling:\nIf the clay swells due to adsorption of NAPL (as happens when used to treat\nother contaminants) and blocks flow paths, contaminated groundwater and NAPL\ncould be diverted to other locations, either in the Canal or into basements, utility\ncorridors, or other subsurface openings around the Canal. (NYCDEP Proposed\nPlan comment #9.2.a., page 60).\nElsewhere in Proposed Plan comment #9, however, NYCDEP states that “the soft\nsediment… currently retards upward groundwater flow...” (NYCDEP Proposed Plan\ncomment #9.1, page 59). As noted previously, the contaminated CSO solids partially\nadsorb NAPL. Given these current conditions, the EPA believes that the overall change\nin post-remedial upwelling conditions will be much less significant than suggested. The\nEPA also believes that an engineered cap can be designed to both absorb NAPL\ncontamination and accommodate groundwater upwelling more effectively than the\ncurrent layers of contaminated CSO solids and other accumulated soft sediments.\nAs noted previously, NYCDEP has submitted a CSO Sediment Mound Dredging Permit\nApplication. That work entails the partial dredging and capping of the northernmost 825\nfeet of the canal, where groundwater upwelling is the greatest. As NYCDEP’s design of\nits CSO sediment dredging and capping work will present many of the same issues\nregarding groundwater upwelling and sediment transport, the EPA will make itself\navailable to coordinate and collaborate with NYCDEP if that work proceeds separately\nfrom the selected remedy.\nComment #158: A commenter asked what measures will be taken to prevent the\noverflow of the Gowanus Canal as a result of storm events such as Superstorm Sandy?\nResponse #158: The remediation of the canal does not include flood prevention\nmeasures. As noted earlier, this issue is dominated by the topography of the area,\namong other factors. Minor improvements in flood capacity may be created through\nimplementation of the selected remedy. The most significant improvement will result\nV-104\nfrom addressing the contaminated sediments through the selected remedy, so that\nwhen flooding occurs, the heavily-contaminated sediments that currently exist in the\ncanal will not be available for the storm to transport, creating potential exposure for\nresidents near the canal. Implementation of contaminated CSO solids controls will\nreduce recontamination of the canal and reduce the CWA risk from sewage pathogens\nwhich, depending on conditions, are discharged to the canal, into streets during\nbackups or transported by flooding.\nComment #159: Several commenters opined that sewer backups into homes when\nthere are heavy rains and storms and the flooding of the adjacent neighborhoods with\nsewage during Superstorm Sandy makes resolving the CSO problem a priority.\nResponse #159: Although not considered for Superfund remedy selection purposes, a\nscreening level risk assessment for CSO pathogens that was performed by National\nGrid found significant risk to child and adult recreational users and workers from CSO-\nrelated pathogen exposure. The CSO water quality issues and impacts to the\ncommunity will be addressed independently by the LTCP. The potential impacts of\nCSO discharges of toxic contaminated solids to a completed canal-bottom remedy are\naddressed by the selected remedy. As noted previously, a secondary benefit of the\ncontaminated CSO solids controls to be implemented as part of the selected remedy will\nbe reductions in sewage releases and associated pathogens.\nComment #160: A commenter recommended that the dredging of the canal be delayed\ntwo years while the circumstances of the silt and mud entering the homes and business\nalong the Gowanus Canal from Superstorm Sandy are assessed.\nResponse #160: Based on sampling conducted by the EPA, it does not appear that\nmaterial from the bottom of the canal was transported via flood waters to any significant\nextent as a result of Superstorm Sandy. Under different conditions, the EPA believes\nthat sediment transport could potentially occur. The EPA believes that implementing\nthe selected remedy is the most appropriate way to reduce this exposure pathway.\nComment #161: A commenter expressed concern that since the sampling of the\nsediments to determine their composition and toxicity was performed prior to\nSuperstorm Sandy, the data is no longer valid. Another commenter expressed concern\nthat the amount of contamination in the “lesser contaminated” sediments located in the\nlower portion of the canal may now be higher as a result of the storm.\nResponse #161: The sample results from the RI show significant levels of\ncontamination in the canal sediments. It is unlikely that the CSO and surface\ndischarges to the canal during Superstorm Sandy significantly altered the toxicity of the\nsediments. Contamination is present throughout the accumulated sediment, which\nvaries in thickness but is an average of ten feet. In addition, as was noted in the prior\nresponse, it does not appear that material from the bottom of the canal was affected by\nthe flood waters to any significant extent as a result of Superstorm Sandy. Although the\ncontaminant levels in the lower portion of the canal are relatively less contaminated than\nV-105\nthe very heavily contaminated upper or middle portion, the lower canal sediments still\nhave high contaminant levels.\nComment #162: A commenter expressed support for excavating the buried turning\nbasin at 1st Street to reduce flooding. Several other commenters suggested that the fill\nin the 5th Street turning basin be excavated to restore as much original water holding\ncapacity as possible to minimize flooding in the area.\nResponse #162: Since the water level in the canal is influenced by the tide and the\nwater level in the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay, restoring the 1st and 5th\nStreet turning basins would not greatly increase the water holding capacity or minimize\nflooding. Unless dikes are installed along the canal, as long as the areas surrounding\nthe canal are near sea level, they can potentially flood during storm events.\nInterim Combined Sewer Overflow Controls\nComment #163: National Grid noted that the Proposed Plan recognizes that retention\ntanks will take time to design and install and, therefore, proposes to use unidentified\ninterim CSO controls. National Grid suggested that these interim controls be identified\nin the ROD.\nResponse #163: The Proposed Plan and ROD recognize that planning and construction\nof permanent long-term contaminated CSO solids controls for the remedy may not fully\nalign with implementation of the remedial dredging. Despite this, the EPA’s goal is to\nimplement the contaminated CSO solids controls as soon as possible to minimize\ninterim impacts and the need to resort to interim controls.\nIf interim contaminated CSO solids controls are necessary, the EPA plans to work\nclosely with NYSDEC and NYCDEP during the remedial design to establish effective\ninterim CSO solids control measures to be implemented until the permanent\ncontaminated CSO solids controls are in place. While interim controls may be\nemployed, critical to the sustained long-term performance of the CERCLA remedy is the\nimplementation of permanent controls such as CSO retention tanks as presented in the\nproposed plan.\nEffectiveness and Locations of Retention Tanks\nComment #164: National Grid states that the proposed CSO controls are inadequate.\nThe Sediment Management Workgroup stated that while retention tanks may be an\nappropriate control as a general matter, it is unclear whether they will be sufficient to\nappreciably reduce the contaminant loadings to the canal from the CSOs. Community\nBoard 6 suggests that:\n Use of large in-line retention tanks appears to have great merit; however they\nwere not evaluated in detail.\nV-106\n Other potential beneficial elements that would add further value to CSO controls ,\nsuch as deodorization treatment and other possible in-vessel pre-treatment,\nshould be considered.\nResponse #164: In-line and off-line retention tanks capture combined sewer flow for\nsubsequent treatment. Off-line retention tanks are constructed as either flow-through\nfacilities where all CSO volume that would otherwise be discharged into a body of water\npasses into the tank, with volumes exceeding the capacity of the tank being discharged\nto receiving waters, or are constructed as surge tanks that when filled to capacity, are\nshut off from the system and then opened later to dewater. Closed concrete tanks are\ngenerally constructed below grade and provide a completely enclosed unit for the\nstorage of captured CSO.\nNYCDEP has constructed and operates four CSO retention facilities at Spring Creek,\nFlushing Creek, Paerdegat Basin and Alley Creek. Storage tanks are sized to provide\nthe desired level of CSO control for a particular site. Pollutant removal is achieved by\nretaining the CSO in the tank then draining and treating the effluent at the wastewater\ntreatment plant when the storm event has passed and the tank contents can be directed\nto the WWTP. The pollutant removal is achieved by the volumetric reduction of\ndischarges provided by the volume of the tank and the hydraulics of the system. If a\nfacility is a flow-through storage system that discharges, it may achieve a preliminary if\nnot primary level of wastewater treatment on discharges if designed to do so. Some\nfacilities have enhanced treatment capabilities by adding chemicals to enhance settling\nof solids in the tanks and disinfection to further reduce bacteria discharges.\nThe two retention tanks presented in the Proposed Plan and ROD would achieve\nvolumetric CSO reductions by providing either in-line or off-line storage depending on\nthe locations and how sewer routing is designed to and from the tanks.\nThe two CSO retention tanks described in the Proposed Plan were conceptually\npresented as being installed on NYC-owned properties to minimize the time and\nexpense of acquiring property. One of the tanks was conceptually presented as being\ninstalled at the Douglass & Degraw Pool/Thomas Greene playground. This location\nwas identified as a possible location because the property is owned by NYC and is a\nformer MGP facility that will likely need to be remediated. Although a remedy for this\nparcel has not yet been selected, such a remedy may potentially include excavation of\ncontaminated MGP-related waste beneath the pool. As an owner of this contaminated\nState Superfund property, NYCDEP is also a PRP. The EPA recognizes that there may\nbe temporary impacts on the community during the remediation of the contamination at\nthe park and the construction of a CSO tank, if located there. Construction of a CSO\ntank at the park would reduce uncontrolled CSO discharges which currently impact the\ncommunity.\nIt should be noted that NYCDEP has located its four CSO retention facilities in NYC\nparks in Brooklyn and Queens. Similarly, NYCDEP is currently constructing its Croton\nWater Filtration Plant at the Mosholu Golf Course in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.\nAlthough such actions may have required state legislative authorization, such approvals\nare routinely sought and obtained. (See, e.g., http://www.nytimes.com/\nV-107\n2013/07/25/nyregion/city-council-approves-tennis-stadium-plan-in-queens.html) In each\nof the CSO retention tanks instances, NYCDEP has located, designed and constructed\nits facilities to minimize short- and long-term impacts on the communities, if not enhance\nthe services it provides the communities. NYCDEP’s Flushing Creek, Paerdegat Basin\nand Alley Creek facilities all provide enhanced environmental, community and\nrecreational benefits to their local residents.\nThe EPA intends to work collaboratively with NYCDEP and the State of New York to\nlocate the CSO storage tanks such that they will provide the most cost-effective\ncontaminated CSO solids controls that sustain the remedy while minimizing the cost\nand impact on the local community.\nRetention Tank Costs\nComment #165: NYCDEP states that the costs for CSO controls are not accurate.\nNYCDEP suggests that the following items should be included:\n Several construction cost items\n Operation and maintenance (O&M)\n Property acquisition and development costs\n Permitting\n Demolition\n Soil and groundwater management costs\n Dewatering costs\n New York general contractor costs\n Health and safety costs\n Operation and maintenance equipment costs\n Site constraints\n Foundations\n Construction access\n Construction parking\nResponse #165: NYCDEP provided an extensive list of cost items potentially applicable\nto constructing belowground retention tanks. Although the EPA agrees that these items\nmay be needed for a budget authorization estimate, this level of detail is not needed for\nan FS cost estimate. The 2000 EPA document “A Guide to Developing and\nDocumenting Cost Estimates During the Feasibility Study” (EPA 540-4-00-002) states\nthe following (underlining added for emphasis):\nWhile cost estimates are developed at different stages of the Superfund process\n(Chapter 2), this guide specifically addresses the FS phase. Cost estimates are\ndeveloped during the FS primarily for the purpose of comparing remedial\nalternatives during the remedy selection process, not for establishing project\nbudgets or negotiating Superfund enforcement settlements. During remedy\nselection, the cost estimate of the preferred alternative is typically carried over\nfrom the FS to the Proposed Plan for public comment.\nV-108\nIn addition, the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering indicates that a\nfeasibility level cost estimate is considered a Class 5 estimate and can be developed\nwith one to two percent project definition. The following provides a description of the\nClass 5 estimate:\nClass 5 estimates are generally prepared based on very limited information, and\nsubsequently have very wide accuracy ranges. Often, little more than Proposed\nPlant type, location, and capacity are known at the time of estimate preparation.\nThe 2000 EPA Guide further states:\nAt the FS stage, the design for the remedial action project is still conceptual, not\ndetailed, and the cost estimate is considered to be “order-of-magnitude.” The\ncost engineer must make assumptions about the detailed design in order to\nprepare the cost estimate. As a project progresses, the design becomes more\ncomplete and the cost estimate becomes more “definitive,” thus increasing the\naccuracy of the cost estimate.”\nThe EPA developed conceptual cost estimates for the construction costs of below-\nground storage tanks to retain CSO at outfalls RH-034 and RH-007. The sizes of the\ntanks range from 2 million gallon to 17 million gallon at outfall RH-034 and 2 million\ngallon to 8.2 million gallon at outfall OH-007. These ranges of tank sizes are the same\nthat the NYCDEP previously evaluated in its WWFP.\nThe EPA’s construction cost estimate ranges from about $25 million to $79 million at\nRH-034 and from about $24 million to $46 million at OH-007. For costing purposes, an\n8-million-gallon in-line storage tank was estimated by the EPA to cost $46,429,000 for\noutfall RH-034 and a 4-million-gallon in-line storage tank was estimated by the EPA to\ncost $31,272,000 for outfall OH-007.\nThe EPA acknowledges that these conceptual construction costs are significantly less\nthan those estimated by NYCDEP in its WWFP and Proposed Plan comments. The\nEPA’s costs are distinguishable from NYCDEP’s cost numbers for a number of reasons,\ndiscussed below.\nIn 2011, the EPA informally requested that NYCDEP provide the basis for NYCDEP’s\nestimates of tank costs in its WWFP. When NYCDEP did not do so, in September 2012\nthe EPA requested this information using CERCLA formal information gathering\nauthority. As was noted previously, NYCDEP screened out CSO tanks for not being\ncost effective based on the cost estimates set forth in the WWFP. In its response to the\nformal request, NYCDEP replied that this information was not available. As a result, no\ndirect NYCDEP cost data was included in the EPA’s formulation of the conceptual costs\nfor the Proposed Plan.\nThe EPA’s costs assume the use of NYC land, which was not the case in the WWFP.\nThe EPA’s cost estimate may be considered in context with these CSO tanks recently\nbuilt by NYCDEP:\n $291 million was spent on its 43 million gallon capacity Flushing Bay CSO facility\ncompleted in 2009.\nV-109\n $33 million was spent on the five million gallon capacity CSO retention tank at Alley\nCreek CSO facility in Bayside, Queens, completed in May 2011.\n $404 million was spent on the 50 million gallon capacity Paerdegat Basin CSO\nfacility in Brooklyn, which began operation in May 2011.\nA comparison of costs is complicated by the fact that the construction costs of these\nfacilities include more than just the costs of constructing below-ground storage tanks.\nAll three of the examples were integrated with other municipal and community\namenities, including operation support facilities, community centers and additional park\nfacilities. The actual construction costs of the storage tank component of the facilities\nwould be only a portion of the overall costs shown above.\nNYCDEP provided a breakdown of the $101 million tank-related costs for the Alley\nCreek CSO facility in its comments on the Proposed Plan. The construction cost of the\nCSO control elements in NYCDEP’s 2007 Alley Creek Waterbody/Watershed Facility\nPlan was, however, estimated to be only $28,000,000 (NYCDEP, 2007) after\nconstruction was underway, which is significantly less than the final actual costs\nincurred of $101 million that NYCDEP reported and consistent with the EPA’s estimate\nfor the Gowanus Canal storage tanks for the selected remedy. NYCDEP has also\nreported to the public in other forums regarding the cost of the Alley Creek tank itself\n(see NYCDEP Presentation, Public Outreach for Alley Creek LTCP, Queens Borough\nPresident Office, September 12, 2012 (“Phase 2: 5 [Million Gallon] CSO Storage Tank\n($33M)”), page 4 and NYCDEP Presentation, Combined Sewer Overflow/Long Term\nControl Plans - Alley Creek Kickoff Meeting, October 24, 2012 (“5 [Million Gallon] CSO\nStorage Tank ($29M)”), page 16). The basis and components of the conceptual costs\nestimated by the EPA are well documented in the FS report addendum and will be\nfurther developed during detailed design. Based on the EPA’s best estimate of the\ndirect tank-related construction costs for the Alley Creek facility, NYCDEP’s as-built\nconstruction cost of storage tanks is approximately $5.60 to $6.60 million per million\ngallons in terms of 2007 to 2012 dollars. This range of costs is consistent with the\nEPA’s estimate for the selected remedy considering the limited Site-specific information\navailable to the EPA.\nRegarding operation and maintenance costs, the EPA reviewed the WWFP for such\ninformation in connection with the document’s cost-effectiveness screening of CSO\noptions. It does not appear that non-capital costs, such as operation and maintenance,\nwere included in NYCDEP’s cost screening for either non-selected elements, such as\nCSO tanks, or selected elements, such as the Flushing Tunnel upgrade. See WWFP,\nSection 7. Such costs could be significant, since, for example, the Flushing Tunnel\nupgrade will result in operational costs 24 hours per day in perpetuity.\nAlthough, as noted above, NYCDEP’s Proposed Plan comments list CSO retention tank\ncost categories which NYCDEP asserts should be included, NYCDEP’s comments do\nnot provide any unit cost estimates derived from NYCDEP’s existing CSO tank\noperations. In its comments on the Proposed Plan, NYCDEP does, however, state:\nV-110\nfor the Alley Creek tank, [NYCDEP’s] operating costs have been approximately\n$1 million per year and grit removal at the Flushing CSO storage tank facility has\ncost up to $2 million per year (NYCDEP comments, page. 99).\nNYCDEP information indicates that the Flushing Creek CSO retention facility consists of\na 28 million gallon tank and plus 15 million gallons of in-line storage from the sewer line\ncapacity, for a total of 43 million gallons. See NYCDEP 2011 Flushing Creek, Section\n8. This is significantly larger than the estimated combined volumes for CSO retention\nfacilities in the selected remedy. Presumably, the costs would be fractionally smaller.26\nRegarding the disposal cost for solids and grit which accumulate in the CSO tanks, cost\nincreases related to O&M for the retention tanks should reflect reductions in\nmaintenance in the canal. Constructing CSO storage tanks will reduce the need for\nmaintenance dredging. NYCDEP evaluated maintenance dredging as part of its CSO\nsolids controls FS and estimated the costs to range between $10.8 million to $28 million\n(NYCDEP, 2012). NYCDEP concluded that there will be some effectiveness of\nmaintenance dredging. The EPA agrees that there will be some effectiveness, but it will\nnot keep hazardous substances out of the canal and will most likely result in periodic\ntoxicity in the sediments. Furthermore, the design of the cap would have to account for\nmore-frequent maintenance dredging in the future such that the cap construction cost\nwill be higher than what is estimated for the proposed plan. NYCDEP savings from the\ncosts of this maintenance dredging would offset the cost for constructing and operating\nCSO storage tanks.\nAlthough the EPA did not include the cost of O&M for the CSO tank in the Proposed\nPlan, the EPA has addressed those costs in the ROD.\nWhile the CSO tank construction will be a moderately complex engineering project, the\nEPA believes that project synergies and the ability to utilize CERCLA-specific\nauthorities related to, for example, project siting and the environmental impact\nstatement process, will significantly reduce the cost of implementation when compared\nto a non-CERCLA NYCDEP-lead project.\nConsideration of First Flush Effect for Sizing Retention Facilities\nComment #166: NYCDEP and National Grid assert that sizing the CSO control volume\nusing the first flush volume underestimates the storage volume needed.\nResponse #166: The concept behind the term ''first flush,\" is that in the early stages of a\nstorm event or CSO event, a relatively small percentage of the total flow contains a\ndisproportionately large percentage of the total pollutant mass associated with the\n26 NYCDEP comments elsewhere suggest that the solids contribution from CSOs is\nsmall relative to harbor solids. (See Comment/Response #138, above). Although the\nEPA believes that this assertion is not supported by the record, if correct, the disposal\ncosts for captured solids would also be reduced.\nV-111\noverall storm event (EPA, 1993). The first flush phenomenon is well documented in the\nscientific literature. Capture and storage of the first flush component of CSO discharges\nusing retention basins are often one of the best measures for attenuating peak runoff\nflows and pollutant loads (EPA, 1999). The fundamental concept of first flush is\napplicable for both combined sewer systems and separated storm sewer systems,\nbecause both collect precipitation and go through some of the same hydrological and\nphysical processes, such as pollutant build-up and wash-off on surfaces, as well as\nsolids accumulation in sewers that are flushed out during rain events.\nNYCDEP and National Grid questioned the validity of the study by Stein et al. (2006)\ncited in the Proposed Plan and whether it represents an appropriate basis for using first\nflush information to evaluate CSO controls. The first flush phenomenon under urban\nsettings with regard to the discharge of contaminants, such as PAHs and metals, has\nbeen studied in various geographic regions in the U. S. that experience different\nhydrologic patterns and various levels of urbanization. The studies noted below\ndemonstrate that first flush phenomenon is observed for various precipitation patterns\nand different chemical compositions, including those for metals and PAHs:\n The study “Water Quality Characterization of Highway Stormwater Runoff from an\nUltra-Urban Area” in Maryland and District of Columbia (Flint and Davis, 2007)\nreported that median values for the mass flushed in the first 25% of runoff volume\nwere greater than the mass flushed in any 25% portion afterwards for all pollutants\n(e.g., metals and nutrients). On average, management of the first half-inch of runoff\nwas able to capture 81-86% of the total pollutant mass at this ultra-urban site. The\nultra-urban area in this study is similar to the neighborhoods around the canal.\n A study funded by California Department of Transportation (Stenstrom and\nKayhanian, 2005) found that 30% to 50% of the pollutants in highway runoff from a\nsingle storm event are contained in the first 10% to 20% of the runoff volume, which\nwould mean that capturing the first 20% of the discharge flow can capture 50% of\nthe pollutants. Specifically for PAH loading, particulate PAHs were dominant and in\nmost cases, first flushes of particulate PAHs were exhibited. The mass first flush\nratio generally was above 2 for the first 20% of the runoff volume, and in some cases\nas high as 2. 8. The results suggest that controls that address particulate phase\ncontaminants in the initial runoff can have greater effectiveness for particulate PAH\nremoval than other types of control strategies (Stenstrom and Kayhanian, 2005).\n In another study in California (Lau et. al., 2009), approximately 30% to 35% of mass\n(for metals and PAHs) is discharged in the first 20% of the runoff volume. This study\nagreed with other highway runoff characterization studies, in that strong correlations\nwere observed among the heavy metals and between heavy metals and total PAHs,\nand TSS were well correlated with most heavy metals.\nIn summary, the findings of these studies across the country are consistent with the\nstudy by Stein et al. (2006), cited in the Proposed Plan, which states that “within\nindividual storms, PAHs exhibited a moderate first flush with between 30% and 60% of\nthe total PAH load being discharged in the first 20% of the storm volume.” Therefore,\nthe use of the first flush concept is valid and applicable to developing preliminary\nestimates of contaminated CSO solids controls for the canal. It should be noted that\nV-112\nabsent the EPA’s planning assumption with respect to the first flush, the size of the\nretention facilities would have to be larger than those described in the Proposed Plan.\nMiscellaneous Retention Tank Concerns\nComment #167: Two commenters asked how the locations for the proposed retention\ntanks were selected. Another commenter asked why other locations, such as the empty\nConEd lot located at the intersection of Nevins and Butler or one of the numerous\nparcels of land that is for sale in the immediate vicinity, were not considered either for\nthe siting of the retention tank or for relocation of the pool and services.\nResponse #167: The EPA has not selected a location for construction of CSO retention\ntanks. The EPA anticipates that the locations of the retention tanks will be finalized\nduring the remedial design. A review of the FS process and critical background\ninformation is helpful in understanding how the EPA proposed Thomas Greene Park as\none potential location for a tank.\nNYCDEP is currently undertaking a number of CSO-related improvements in the canal.\nThe improvements will result in substantial reductions of CSO discharges to the mid-\nand lower canal reaches, but no reduction to the upper canal.\nThe EPA determined that CSO solids contaminated with hazardous substances could\nresult in recontamination of the canal. Such organic solids also act as a contaminant\n“sponge,” adsorbing and effectively concentrating other hazardous substances released\ninto the canal. The CSO reductions that the EPA is seeking for the upper canal are\nconsistent with those being made by NYCDEP to the mid and lower canal.\nAfter screening the engineering options which could be used to prevent\nrecontamination, the EPA determined that in-line retention tanks are the most suitable\ntechnology to capture and reduce contaminated sediment from CSO discharges. While\nthe empty Con-Ed lot and the parcels of land that are for sale are potential locations for\nsewage retention tanks, for the purpose of developing construction cost estimates for\nthe contaminated CSO solids controls, it was assumed that the retention tanks could be\nlocated most inexpensively on NYC-owned land in the vicinity of the outfalls. One such\nproperty is the Thomas Greene Park.\nThe EPA acknowledges that the pool and community services provided at the Thomas\nGreene Park are vital local community resources. As is generally known within the\ncommunity, the park is located on a portion of the former Fulton MGP State Superfund\nsite (see: http://www.fultonmgpsite.com). Like the two other former MGP facilities\nalong the canal, Public Place (see http://www.citizensmgpsite.com and Metropolitan\nhttp://www.metropolitanmgpsite.com), the land beneath the park is heavily\ncontaminated with coal tar. To understand the scale of the former MGP cleanups\nneeded along the canal, the combined remediation of the three former MGP facilities is\nexpected to cost roughly the same as the cleanup of the canal itself.\nV-113\nThe largest CSO outfall is located one block from the park. A remedy has not yet been\nselected for the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site (National Grid is currently\nconducting an FS under NYSDEC oversight), but the EPA believes it will likely include\nthe removal of contaminated soil and coal tar beneath and/or near the pool and\ncommunity center. For this excavation to occur, it is likely that the pool would have to\nbe removed and rebuilt, regardless of whether a CSO tank is sited there. If the remedy\ninvolves significant excavation, then there would be significant efficiencies in terms of\ntime and money savings that could be realized for both NYC and National Grid by using\nthe former Fulton MGP State Superfund site for the CSO retention tank. NYC would\nsave money needed to excavate the hole for the tank because National Grid would be\ndoing the excavation as part of the Site remedy and National Grid would save money\nthat would otherwise be spent to backfill the entire hole, because NYC would be placing\na tank in a portion of the hole. NYC would also save the cost of acquiring a separate\nproperty. The pool, which is over 40 years old, also requires upgrading. Overall,\ncombining such cost savings could be considerable. CSO retention tanks, which are\nessentially concrete tanks, have been successfully constructed beneath parks and other\npublicly used areas in other cities. The EPA presented examples of such tanks at\npublic meetings during the comment period.\nIt should be noted that in 2008, prior to the nomination of the Gowanus Canal to the\nNPL, reconstruction of the aging pool was considered by NYC. In 2010, NYC proposed\nclosing the park for budgetary reasons, which remained open after efforts by local\nsupporters. Although a park design was finalized which would move the pool to the\nwestern side of the park from its current position, that plan was not implemented due to\nbudget constraints. As a result, only the uncontaminated eastern section of the park\nhas been renovated, to date, with work being completed in early 2013.\nEven if the pool does not have to be removed, the utilization of heavy construction\nequipment at the park and in surrounding areas of the Site could require the temporary\nclosure of the pool and community center for health and safety reasons. The empty\nCon-Ed lot and the numerous parcels of land that are for sale could be viable locations\nfor a temporary or permanent replacement pool or for an alternative CSO retention tank\nlocation.\nNYC acquired the contaminated land from Brooklyn Union Gas Co. in or around 1938\nand constructed the park. As an owner of a portion of former MGP facility, NYC may\nalso be a PRP under NYS law for the MGP cleanup. NYC could negotiate with National\nGrid for compensation for the loss of the park during the time that the remediation effort\nblocks public use of the park and possibly reach an agreement related to the provision\nof temporary facilities. As part of implementing the comprehensive remedy for the\ncanal and collaborating with the NYSDEC and the PRPs, the EPA will continue to\nconduct appropriate outreach with the community in order to minimize project impacts to\nthe extent practical.\nV-114\nComment #168: A commenter asked whether retention tanks which can store excess\nsewage and stormwater flow until the wet weather subsides so that it can be pumped to\nthe wastewater treatment plants would be a permanent solution to the CSO problem.\nResponse #168: Installing retention tanks to store excess sewage and stormwater flows\nis one permanent way to address the CSO problem. NYCDEP has built four retention\ntanks elsewhere in NYC--in Spring Creek, Flushing Bay, Alley Creek and Paerdegat\nBasin. Two of these retention tanks are significantly larger than what would be needed\nfor the Gowanus Canal.\nComment #169: Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed installation\nof a CSO retention tank at the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site would require\nthe temporary removal of the community pool and the community center that provides a\nfree breakfast and lunch program. A commenter requested a guarantee that there\nwould be no disruption to the facilities and services.\nResponse #169: The EPA is committed to achieving cost savings by working closely\nwith NYCDEP to accomplish an effective Superfund cleanup while also realizing CSO\nbenefits through synergies and economies of scale. The EPA anticipates that the\nremedy that is ultimately selected by NYSDEC for the former Fulton MGP State\nSuperfund site will require the excavation of contaminated soils underlying the pool and\ncommunity center. A retention tank could be installed in the excavated area before\nbackfilling. Even if the pool does not have to be removed, the utilization of heavy\nconstruction equipment on and around the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site will\nlikely require the temporary closure of the pool and community center for safety\nreasons. As was noted previously, NYC could negotiate with National Grid for\ncompensation for the loss of the park during the time that the remediation effort blocks\npublic use of the park and possibly reach an agreement related to the provision of\ntemporary facilities. As part of implementing the comprehensive remedy for the canal\nand collaborating with the NYSDEC and the PRPs, the EPA will continue to conduct\nappropriate outreach with the community in order to minimize project impacts to the\nextent practical.\nComment #170: A commenter noted that NYC’s planning standards outlined in the 2010\nCity Environmental Quality Review Technical (CEQR) Manual encourages 2. 5 acres of\nopen space within half a mile for every 1,000 residents. The commenter noted that a\nCAG member estimated that northern Gowanus residents only have access to 7 acres\nof parks instead of the 70 acres that the standard requires. The commenter asked how\nthe EPA would enforce NYC open space standards for the already underserved part of\nthe Gowanus Canal community.\nResponse #170: Under the CEQR Manual (updated in 2012), an analysis of open space\nis conducted to determine whether or not a proposed project would have a direct impact\nresulting from the elimination or alteration of open space and/or an indirect impact\nresulting from overtaxing available open space. Since the excavation of contaminated\nsoils underlying the pool and community center and the installation of a retention tank in\nV-115\nthe excavation before backfilling would only be a temporary loss of the open space, it\nwould appear that the open space requirements under CEQR may not be applicable.\nThe EPA does not have the authority to enforce NYC open space standards, nor are\nsuch standards considered an applicable and appropriate requirement for the federal\nSuperfund process. The EPA supports open space efforts that may benefit the remedy\nfor the Site, such as the Sponge Park, green street ends and other green infrastructure\nprojects. The EPA has also encouraged NYC to re-start the area-wide re-zoning\nprocess which may result in additional open space through the application of waterfront\nesplanade requirements.\nComment #171: A commenter asked whether the proposed sewage retention tanks\ncould be sited to take into consideration the expected sea level rise and the attendant\nramifications.\nResponse #171: The retention tanks will be buried in the ground well below the\nsurface. Rising sea levels will not have an impact on such watertight tanks.\nConstruction of the retention tanks would be expected to partially alleviate sewage\ndischarges from increased storm events.\nComment #172: Several commenters expressed concern that the size and number of\nretention tanks will not be sufficient, given the significant amount of planned residential\ndevelopment.\nResponse #172: Contaminated CSO solids reductions needed to achieve the PRGs in\nsurface sediments after remedy implementation are estimated to be in the range of 58\nto 74 percent. Scientific literature suggests that it can be assumed that the \"first flush\"\ncomprises approximately 20% of the total discharge volume and contains between 30%\nand 60% of the total PAH load of the discharge. It is anticipated that capturing\napproximately twice the amount of the \"first flush\" of the design storm event from CSO\noutfalls RH-034 and OH-007 would ensure that the protectiveness of the remedy is\nmaintained. In order to achieve this minimum level of CSO solids control, based on the\npreliminary screening, in-line retention tanks are presumed to be constructed near\noutfalls RH-034 and OH-007; tank volumes of 6- to 8-million gallons and 3- to 4-million\ngallons were preliminarily selected for outfalls RH-034 and OH-007, respectively, on the\nbasis of their capacity to reduce CSO volume and solids that will be protective of the\nSuperfund remedy. During the remedial design process, further refinement of the CSO\nreduction targets will occur.\nThe ROD requires that current and future high density residential redevelopment along\nthe banks of the canal and within the sewershed be consistent with current NYCDEP\ncriteria to ensure that hazardous substances and solids from additional sewage loads\ndo not compromise the effectiveness of the permanent CSO control measures (i.e., the\ntanks) by exceeding their design capacity. The ROD also requires that the size of the\ntanks, which will be determined during the remedial design, accommodate projected\nadditional loads to the combined sewer system as a result of current and future\nresidential development, as well as a result of increased rainfall due to climate change.\nV-116\nTherefore, it is likely that the tanks will need to be larger to accommodate the\naforementioned factors.\nComment #173: A commenter asked whether the proposed retention tanks would have\nsufficient volume to be able to retain 40% (twice the amount of the \"first flush\" of the\ndesign storm event) of the discharge volume that would be expected from storms\nequivalent to Hurricane Irene or Superstorm Sandy.\nResponse #173: While the retention tanks would retain twice the amount of the \"first\nflush\" of the design storm event, it is likely that extraordinary storm events, which cause\nwidespread flooding, would exceed the design storm event. As was noted in the\nprevious response, it is likely that the tanks will need to be larger to accommodate\nprojected additional loads to the combined sewer system as a result of current and\nfuture residential development and increased rainfall.\nComment #174: Several commenters expressed concern about the potential loss of the\nThomas Greene Park and the Douglass-Degraw Pool should a CSO retention tank be\nsited there. Another commenter asked how the EPA will protect residents from\ntemporarily or permanently losing green and recreational space. Several commenters\nasked about the time frame that the pool would be closed.\nResponse #174: The specific locations of the retention tanks will be selected in\nconsultation with NYCDEP. The EPA is committed to achieving cost savings by\nworking closely with NYCDEP to accomplish an effective Superfund cleanup while also\nrealizing CSO benefits through synergies and economies of scale. Accordingly, the\nEPA intends to work with NYCDEP to evaluate locating CSO control facilities in areas\nwhere upland Site-related source removal work might take place, creating a synergy\nbetween programs that potentially could save time in property acquisition and permitting\nand save significant construction costs.\nAs was noted above, the swimming pool and park are located on the former Fulton\nMGP State Superfund site, which is currently owned by NYC. The former Fulton MGP\nState Superfund site is a current source of contamination to the canal through the\nmigration of contaminated groundwater and coal tar. The facility is being addressed\nunder the State Superfund program by National Grid, a PRP for the facility. As a\ncurrent owner of the park, NYC may also be a PRP for the remediation of the Fulton\nMGP site under NYS law. It is likely that the remedy for contamination beneath the park\nfacility will include the excavation of contaminated soil and coal tar. To do so, it is likely\nthat the pool would have to be removed. The EPA has suggested that a retention tank\nbe installed before backfilling as a means of solving several problems at the least cost.\nThe EPA is open to other locations that NYC (the party that will be responsible for\nbuilding the tank) may propose as appropriate and advantageous.\nEven if the pool does not have to be removed, the utilization of heavy construction\nequipment on the Site will likely require the temporary closure of the pool and\ncommunity center during the MGP cleanup for health and safety reasons.\nV-117\nThe EPA acknowledges that there may be some temporary impacts to the users of the\npool if the pool is temporarily closed due to excavation of contamination on or near the\npark, and/or construction of a tank. As was noted previously, NYC could negotiate with\nNational Grid for compensation for the loss of the park during the time that the\nremediation effort blocks public use of the park and possibly reach an agreement\nrelated to the provision of temporary facilities. As part of implementing the\ncomprehensive remedy for the canal and in collaboration with NYSDEC and the PRPs,\nthe EPA will continue to conduct appropriate outreach with the community in order to\nminimize project impacts to the extent practical.\nWhile detailed construction schedules are not developed until the design phase, it is\nanticipated that work associated with the construction of an underground retention tank\nwould take two to three years.\nComment #175: Two commenters asked about the potential exposure pathway a\nsewage retention tank beneath the pool would create.\nResponse #175: Temporarily storing sewage in an underground tank is a common\npractice in NYC and elsewhere. While somewhat more complex, sewage tanks are\nfundamentally similar in nature to other subsurface sewer infrastructure like sewage\nlines in streets.\nParks and other public accessible facilities have been successfully constructed above\nsuch tanks and other sewage-related infrastructure. For example, a public park is\nlocated above the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant on the West Side Highway\n(see http://nysparks.com/parks/93 and http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/wastewater/\nnorthri.shtml). In Marseille, France, a CSO tank is being constructed beneath a park,\nadjacent to an historic monumental arch.\nDuring the public comment period, the EPA’s presentations to the public included\nseveral examples of CSO tanks constructed beneath a park and other public areas. A\nCSO retention tank would not pose a threat to an overlying swimming pool.\nComment #176: A commenter noted that more than $900,000 was spent by NYC to\nrenovate the playground at the Thomas Greene Park, which is located on the former\nFulton MGP State Superfund site, but the underlying land was not first remediated. Two\ncommenters note that the new playground has large tree pits with exposed dirt and a\nnew sprinkler fountain for children and suggests that both be evaluated as potential new\nexposure routes. A commenter suggested regular testing of the water in the Douglass\n& Degraw Community Pool and drinking and shower water at the pool. One commenter\nexpressed general concern about the potential health risks posed to the users of the\npark and pool. A commenter also expressed concern about potential exposure through\ncontaminated groundwater infiltrating the bottom of the toddler and regular pools.\nSeveral commenters suggest that the EPA conduct a thorough review of the remedial\ninvestigation results at the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site and address new\npotential exposure pathways with a human health risk assessment.\nV-118\nResponse #176: The playground at the park is located on an area where contamination\nwas not detected, allowing work to proceed on the recent playground renovation. By\ncontrast, substantial contamination was found under the remaining portions of the park.\nCurrent and future human health risks associated with the Site were assessed in the\nformer Fulton MGP State Superfund site RI report prepared by National Grid under\nNYSDEC oversight. The RI report concludes that under current conditions, the\ncontaminated soils pose no risk to human health because the contamination is located\nunderground and is, thus, not readily accessible. The RI report also concludes that\nthere are potential future pathways by which human receptors could come into contact\nwith contaminated soils and groundwater, soil vapor and indoor air. In addition, utility\nand construction workers may come into contact with contaminants in subsurface soils\nat each of the parcels and beneath the streets during excavation activities. Since the\nsoil surrounding the trees was likely imported and since the piping for the sprinklers,\nshowers and drinking water is under pressure (water can leak out of the pipes, but\ninfiltration of contaminants into the piping from the groundwater is virtually impossible\ndue to the positive water pressure in the pipes), the potential for exposure via these\nroutes is unlikely.\nComment #177: Several commenters noted that, although concern has been\nexpressed about the placement of retention tanks at Thomas Greene Park, the soil in a\nportion of the park is contaminated and needs to be cleaned up. The commenters note\nthat the loss of a swimming area for several seasons is a small price to pay to eliminate\nthe CSO discharges.\nResponse #177: The Thomas Greene Park swimming pool is located on a portion of the\nformer Fulton MGP State Superfund site. As was noted above, it is likely that the\nremedy for the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site will include the excavation of\ncontaminated soil and coal tar, which could necessitate the removal of the pool.\nThe EPA has suggested that a retention tank be installed beneath the park before\nbackfilling and reconstruction of the pool as a means to reduce NYC’s property\nacquisition and construction costs. This approach would solve several problems at\nonce, including reducing the community’s exposure to CSO discharges, which can\noccur both into the canal and into public streets, depending on the circumstances.\nAlthough the park has been proposed by the EPA as a potential location, NYC will be\ngiven the opportunity to select a location for the retention tank during the remedial\ndesign process.\nComment #178: A commenter requested groundwater testing at the park after wet\nweather events.\nResponse #178: Since the groundwater underlying the park is known to be\ncontaminated, sampling it after wet weather events would only confirm that which is\nalready known about the MGP-related contamination there.\nV-119\nComment #179: A commenter asked about the likelihood that a public park could be\nplaced on top of the retention tanks.\nResponse #179: Construction of a park on top of the retention tanks is readily feasible.\nMoreover, in this case it could potentially save significant costs by combining the\nsolutions for multiple capital-intensive projects. During the public comment period, the\nEPA’s presentations to the public included several examples of CSO tanks constructed\nbeneath a park and other public areas. See: http://www.epa.gov/region02/\nsuperfund/npl/gowanus/pdf/present_cagmtg_02-2013.pdf.\nAs noted above, there is also a park atop the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant\nin NYC.\nComment #180: Councilmember Brad Lander indicated that his office is partnering with\nthe NYC Department of Sanitation and the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, with the\nsupport of Councilmember Stephen Levin and Councilmember Sara González, to\nconstruct a composting facility on the NYC-owned property located at 2nd Avenue and\n5th Street, another potential location for an in-line retention tank. It is anticipated that\nthe construction of the facility will begin in summer 2013, pending regulatory approval.\nCouncilmember Lander requested that before any final decisions are made about the\nsiting of a retention tank at this location, he would like details about the proposal and\nwhat the potential impacts might be.\nResponse #180: The EPA has reviewed the composting facility’s plans and met with the\nGowanus Canal Conservancy in April 2013 at the composting facility to work out an\narrangement that would allow both the composting and in-line retention tank projects to\nmove forward (i.e., the components of the composting facility will be portable). The\nEPA will continue to conduct appropriate outreach with the community in order to\nminimize project impacts to the extent practical on this and other efforts along the canal.\nComment #181: A commenter asked how the locations of the CSO retention tanks\nwould be selected and approved.\nResponse #181: It is up to NYCDEP—the party that will be responsible for building the\nretention tanks—to propose even further CSO controls if additional steps are necessary\nto achieve the water quality goals of the CWA and meet the “highest attainable use” for\nthe water body.\nThe EPA is seeking to coordinate the CWA and CERCLA processes to the extent\npracticable to ensure that the selected CERCLA remedy is implemented in an effective\nand timely manner. NYSDEC is the lead agency for implementing the CWA in the\nState; the EPA will be participating closely in the LTCP process. The EPA is the lead\nagency for the CERCLA remedy, with NYSDEC as the support agency. The EPA plans\nto coordinate closely with NYSDEC and NYCDEP.\nIt is anticipated that NYCDEP will be performing additional sampling, modeling and\nengineering work which should serve to inform both the remedial design and LTCP\nprocesses, assuming that both efforts are moving in parallel.\nV-120\nIn the event that there are delays in the LTCP process, the EPA will require NYCDEP to\nproceed on the remedial design schedule rather than the LTCP schedule so as to\nprevent delays in the implementation of the CERCLA remedy. It should be noted that\nthe EPA does not believe it is necessary for NYCDEP to finalize the LTCP in order to\ncomplete the remedial design, particularly since the State has already determined that\nthe LTCP must, at a minimum, meet the CERCLA remedy requirements.\nThe EPA’s incorporation of the CSO solids control into the remedy allows the EPA to\nconduct the siting, remedial design and remedial action pursuant to certain CERCLA\nstatutory authorities, including, but not limited to, the availability of permit exemption and\nenvironmental impact statement equivalency. The CERCLA exemption and\nequivalency authorities will help avoid delays in implementing the remedy.\nAs a result, the EPA anticipates that final retention tank site selection will be done under\nthe EPA’s oversight, in consultation with NYSDEC. As noted previously, for the\npurpose of developing estimated construction costs associated with CSO control, it was\nassumed that these tanks could potentially be located on available NYC-owned land in\nthe vicinity of the outfalls. The EPA is open to other locations that NYCDEP may\npropose, as appropriate and advantageous. NYCDEP’s proposed location(s) will be\nsubject to approval by the EPA and NYDSEC during the remedial design and the\ncontemporaneous LTCP development process.\nComment #182: Two commenters expressed concern that the language in the\nProposed Plan calling for the construction of retention basins to address the CSO\nproblem is suggestive, rather than compulsory. They note that since NYC is strapped\nfor funds, it may not “take the hint.”\nResponse #182 While the EPA evaluated several CSO control measures and\ndetermined that retention tanks would be the most viable, the EPA wanted to allow\nNYCDEP the maximum amount of flexibility in selecting CSO control measures.\nTherefore, instead of mandating retention tanks, the Proposed Plan suggested retention\ntanks. It should be noted that the selected remedy includes the installation of retention\ntanks.\nComment #183: Two commenters indicated that while the Proposed Plan takes the\ncritical step of calling for CSO retention tanks for two of the canal's worst outfalls, many\ndetails will not be solidified until NYCDEP submits its LTCP. The commenters further\nstated that it is critical for the EPA to stand firm on requiring retention tanks to control\nCSOs and to work with NYSDEC and NYCDEP toward the eventual goal of 100%\nelimination of CSOs from the canal.\nResponse #183: NYSDEC is currently overseeing work being performed by NYC (NYC)\nto reduce CSOs to the canal by approximately 34 percent in lower and mid-canal\noutfalls. To significantly reduce overall contaminated solid discharges to the canal, the\nselected remedy includes the construction of two in-line sewage/stormwater retention\ntanks in the vicinity of the two major CSO outfalls in the upper reach of the canal. The\nselected remedy also calls for interim controls to mitigate sediment from the CSO\nV-121\ndischarges until the permanent retention tanks are installed if the tanks cannot be\nconstructed prior to the commencement of the dredging remedy.\nWhile complete elimination of all CSOs from the canal is technically possible, it is not\nthe goal of the ROD; the goal is a protective remedy. Scientific literature suggests that\nit can be assumed that the “first flush” comprises approximately 20% of the total\ndischarge volume and contains between 30% and 60% of the total PAH load of the\ndischarge. It is anticipated that capturing twice the amount of the “first flush” of the\ndesign storm event from the two major outfalls located in the upper portion of the canal\n(while at the same time making adjustments for additional loads from projected future\ndevelopment and increased precipitation due to climate change) would ensure that the\nprotectiveness of the remedy is maintained.\nComment #184: A commenter suggested that legal assurances be put into place to\nensure that NYCDEP maintains the retention tanks.\nResponse #184: It is the EPA’s expectation that the performance of the maintenance\nrelated to the retention tanks will be included in the terms of the negotiated agreement\nwith NYC.\nComment #185: A commenter notes that the Proposed Plan states that the EPA and\nNYSDEC are committed to work together throughout the development of the remedial\ndesign and the contemporaneous LTCP development process. The commenter seeks\nclarification on the timing for the development of CSO controls.\nResponse #185: The LTCP is due in June 2015. The EPA will proceed with the design\nof the selected remedy anticipating the contemporaneous completion of the LTCP.\nRecognizing that planning and construction of permanent long-term contaminated CSO\nsolids controls for the Superfund remedy might not take place by the time remedial\ndredging commences, the EPA in consultation with NYSDEC, would develop, or require\nNYCDEP to develop, interim CSO solids control measures during the remedial design\nto control the CSO discharges until the permanent measures are implemented.\nAs was noted previously, in the event that there are delays in the LTCP process, the\nEPA will require NYCDEP to proceed on the remedial design schedule rather than the\nLTCP schedule so as to prevent delays to the implementation of the CERCLA remedy.\nIt should be noted that the EPA does not believe it is necessary for NYCDEP to finalize\nthe LTCP in order to complete the remedial design, particularly since the State has\nalready determined that the LTCP must, at a minimum, meet the CERCLA remedy\nrequirements.\nCompensation for Temporary Loss of Pool Facility\nComment #186: A commenter asked what compensation would be provided to the\ncommunity for losing a recreational open space facility. Another commenter requested\nV-122\nthat the EPA ensure that if a sewage retention tank is placed in Thomas Greene Park\nunder the pool, that the pool and any park be replaced for the entire time that there is\ndisruption to this critical community resource. The commenter also requested that the\ndesign of the replacement pool and park have meaningful involvement from the\ncommunity. Community Board Six asked if an in-line retention tank is sited at the\nThomas Greene Park and Douglass-Degraw Pool, will the EPA help offset the resulting\ntemporary loss of access to this public facility.\nResponse #186: NYC, as owner of the contaminated park property, may be a PRP for\nthe former Fulton MGP State Superfund site and therefore, along with National Grid, the\nsuccessor to the former owner/operator, are the PRPs partly responsible for the former\nMGP facility’s remediation. As the property owner, it is within NYC’s authority to identify\na temporary or permanent location for the pool and implement the transition of the pool\nservices to this new location. As was noted previously, NYC could negotiate with\nNational Grid for compensation for the loss of the park during the time that the\nremediation effort blocks public use of the park and possibly reach an agreement\nrelated to the provision of temporary facilities. As part of implementing the\ncomprehensive remedy for the canal and in collaboration with NYSDEC and the PRPs,\nthe EPA will continue to conduct appropriate outreach with the community in order to\nminimize project impacts to the extent practical.\nIf selected as a CSO retention tank location, the EPA will allow enough lead time during\nthe development of the design for the transitioning of the pool and other community\nservices to an alternate location outside the construction area.\nComment #187: Two commenters expressed concern about who will pay for an\nalternative pool and park and the salaries of the 35 employees.\nResponse #187: National Grid is the primary PRP for the former Fulton MGP State\nSuperfund site. As owner of the park, NYC may also potentially responsible for some\nportion of the former MGP facility’s remediation. As was noted previously, NYC could\nnegotiate with National Grid for compensation for the loss of the park during the time\nthat the remediation effort blocks public use of the park and possibly reach an\nagreement related to the provision of temporary facilities.\nNavigation\nComment #188: National Grid provided comments related to navigation in the canal and\nthe potential for its impact on the benthic layer and cap armor layer. The main\ncomments referred to the likelihood of the benthic layer to be disturbed and mobilized\nby the Flushing Tunnel and commercial vessel traffic that currently traverses the area.\nA secondary comment suggested that the armor cover size is underestimated.\nThe comments were based on a National Grid study which noted that impacts on\nsediment mobility result from:\nV-123\n• Increased flow velocities associated with tug and barge activity\n• Propeller wash\n• Direct vessel contact with the bed\nNational Grid cited the conclusions from the study by remedial target area as follows:\nRTA 1\n• When the Flushing Tunnel becomes active, there will be significant sediment\nerosion and transport from RTA 1 from the increased flow in the canal.\n• The Flushing Tunnel flows, when activated, will scour the sand layer proposed to\nhelp establish the benthic community after completion of the remedial action preventing\necological restoration in the canal.\nRTA 2\n• The Proposed Plan does not account for the full range of vessel impacts such as\nvessel grounding and propeller scour that remobilize and redistribute bed sediments.\n• A sand benthic layer will be unsustainable under the combined effects of\npropeller wash and Flushing Tunnel flow at depths as deep as 30 feet. A significantly\ndeeper dredge depth will be required to accommodate commercial vessel traffic in RTA\n2 if the sand layer is required to support a benthic community.\n• The size of stone assumed in the FS and Proposed Plan for the cap armor layer\nis underestimated for the estimated elevation of the bed in RTA2.\n• The environmental goals of the proposed remedy are not achievable with\ncommercial navigation in RTA 2, therefore removing commercial navigation in RTA 2\nmust be evaluated.\n• In the event that a strategy of eliminating commercial vessel traffic is not pursued\nas part of remediation of the canal, there must be flexibility within the Proposed Plan to\nbe able to evaluate bed elevations and the configuration of any proposed cap and armor\nlayer in light of detailed vessel impacts.\n• If RTA 2 is dredged to accommodate navigation by commercial vessels, RTA 2\nwill suffer ongoing accumulation of sediment. However, a deeper bed configuration in\nRTA2 would be ineffective because it would increase sediment and contaminant\naccumulation, and would lessen the ability of the Flushing Tunnel to address water\nquality issues in this section of the canal.\nResponse #188: Although the Flushing Tunnel will operate at a greater overall capacity,\nthe velocity of the water is expected to be the similar to before the current upgrades.\nThe upgrades will allow the Flushing Tunnel to operate during more hours of the day,\nincreasing the overall volume of water. Due to the geometry of the Flushing Tunnel and\nthe canal (e.g., tunnel discharge angle and curve of the canal) most of the tunnel flow\ndiminishes by mid-canal. As a result, alterations in scouring and sediment transport are\nexpected to be limited. The most significant effect of the Flushing Tunnel is to reduce\nstagnant water conditions in the upper reach of the canal. (NYCDEP 2007 Modeling\nReport; NYCDEP 2008 WWFP).\nV-124\nThere is a balance that the remedial design must accomplish to maintain a benthic\nhabitat, maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations in the canal above regulatory levels,\nand maintain canal use in RTA 2 for commercial navigation. With the Flushing Tunnel\nreactivated, scouring of the sand layer in RTA 1 could affect benthic community\nrestoration. In RTA 2, scouring of the sand layer from navigation could have the same\neffect.\nDespite scouring of the sand in the benthic habitat area, benthic organisms will continue\nto exist in the canal for the following reasons:\n Although it is accurate to assume that unstable sediment conditions will affect the\nbenthic community, scouring will not be uniform across all areas of RTA 1 and RTA\n2.\n Sediment transport will likely also not be uniform across the entire RTA. National\nGrid has collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples throughout the canal under\nthe existing shallow bathymetry conditions, with and without the Flushing Tunnel in\noperation and with the apparent effects of disturbance from tug boat movement in\nthe canal.\n Under the aforementioned current conditions of surface disturbance, National Grid’s\nsampling results showed that benthic macroinvertebrates were found at all locations\nsampled. The quality of the community depended on the quality of the habitat and\nsediment type. The post-remediation habitat should be considerably improved over\ncurrent conditions.\n In areas that will not be subject to significant scouring, the sand layer would remain\nin place to support the presence of benthic communities of a quality corresponding\nto the habitat type.\n In areas with scour, it is reasonable to expect the presence of benthic communities\nthat are adapted to more rocky substrates (like the stones that will comprise the\narmor layer).\n The reduction in CSO discharges and removal of sediment creating SOD in the\nselected remedy will improve dissolved oxygen conditions in the canal. This in turn\nwill reduce the need for the design flows of the reactivated Flushing Tunnel to\nmaintain dissolved oxygen levels since the organic load to the canal will be reduced.\nWith lower water velocities, sediment scour would be lower.\nThe balance of the need to maintain a benthic habitat, maintain dissolved oxygen\nconcentrations in the canal above regulatory levels, and maintain canal use in RTA 2 for\ncommercial navigation will be addressed during the remedial design based on the\nestablished CSO control systems.\nThe FS presented only the conceptual layouts and sizing of the various components of\nthe evaluated remedial alternatives in accordance with the EPA guidance.\nConceptual layout of the armor layer was based on guidance from the EPA guidance\ndocument by Palermo et. al (1998). The influences of twin propellers and rudders were\nnot included in the conceptual layout and these could certainly result in potentially larger\nV-125\nbottom velocities and the need for a larger armor layer. However, the size of the stone\nassumed in the FS for the armor layer is not expected to increase significantly enough\nso as to affect the feasibility of the alternative.\nFinal cap configuration and precise dimensions will be determined during the remedial\ndesign and will include a detailed study of tug-boats and operations in the canal.\nOdors and Pathogens During Construction\nComment #189: The PRP Group stated that there is a need to evaluate migration and\nexposure to airborne bacterial and chemical substances (pharmaceuticals, personal\ncare products, etc.) during dredging under the proposed plan. The comment also noted\nthat the EPA has not considered recent studies by Columbia University that evaluated\nair quality during the ongoing in-canal aeration activities by NYCDEP at Newtown Creek\nand suggest that aeration provides a pathway for microbial exposure.\nResponse #189: Dredging of sediments containing pathogens in waterways with CSO\ndischarges has been performed by NYCDEP (e.g., in the Hendrix Canal) and by many\nother entities at many locations across the United States. Dredged sediments are wet\nand airborne pathogens are not expected from the wet sediments. When sediment is\ndredged, the pathogens are located in the sediment pore water and on the sediment\nsolids. The pathogens would become airborne if particulate matter from the dredged\nsediment becomes airborne. The potential for this happening would be limited by the\nhigh moisture content of the sediment, which will limit the potential for airborne dust\nparticles. Pathogens represent a concern during direct contact. For workers involved in\nthe dredging operation, personal protective equipment will prevent direct contact with\nthe sediments. Hepatitis vaccinations may also be used for added protection by\nworkers in direct contact. Worker exposures to pharmaceuticals and personal care\nproducts in the dredged sediments would also be addressed through personal\nprotective equipment.\nAeration is not planned during sediment dredging as part of the selected remedy.\nUnder existing conditions, the public is exposed to pathogens through CSO discharges\nto the canal, through flooding during storm events and through sewage overflows onto\nthe streets and sidewalks neighboring the canal when high water levels close the tide\ngates at CSO outfalls, causing the sewer backups to occur away from the canal. The\nselected remedy should reduce these conditions. Odor controls will be implemented to\ncontrol odors to the degree practicable. Under current conditions, the CSO sediment\nmounds and frequent CSO events cause uncontrolled odors. The selected remedy,\nonce implemented, should significantly reduce the formation of mounds and the\noccurrence of uncontrolled odors.\n1st Street Turning Basin\nComment #190: NYCDEP provided the following comments on the EPA’s proposed\nexcavation of the 1st Street turning basin:\nV-126\n The proposed excavation is based on very limited data and an evaluation of\nalternatives was not completed.\n The proposed excavation is not consistent with the handling of other upland sites\nalong the Canal and does not comply with any remedy selection requirements under\nCERCLA.\n The estimated costs for the proposed excavation underestimate the project costs.\n There is no indication that property owners or neighboring landowners were\ncontacted and offered an opportunity to participate in the process.\n The EPA should consider the land use impacts of the proposed change.\nResponse #190: The former 1st Street turning basin was originally utilized to deliver coal\nvia barges to the former Brooklyn Rapid Transit Power House. The Power House\nconsumed large quantities of coal. During its operating era, large coal piles surrounded\nthe building until the plant became obsolete and was removed from service. The 1st\nStreet basin was filled in between 1953 and 1965.\nAnalytical data obtained during the RI in the former 1st Street turning basin showed the\nexistence of significant contamination in soil and groundwater above cleanup standards.\nAs with other former basins along the canal, it is believed that contaminated sediments\nwithin the 1st Street basin were left in place when the basin was filled in. In addition,\nthere are indications that the fill itself may have included waste materials. The filled-in\nbasin may also have been subject to later spills and dumping.\nThe EPA installed a paired set of wells within the former 1st Street turning basin, which\nthe EPA believes is an appropriate number of wells for the aerial extent of the parcel,\nand collected sufficient data to characterize the contamination. The data included soil\nborings, visual observations of contamination and multiple rounds of groundwater\nsamples. The wells were installed in a location from which groundwater samples would\nprovide adequate characterization of the groundwater contamination flowing through the\nnarrow parcel of land that constitutes the former 1st Street turning basin. In its\ncomment, NYCDEP indicated that monitoring well MW-27, which does not show\ncontamination at levels of concern, is within the 1st Street turning basin. Monitoring well\nMW-27 is located on the adjacent Power Station property, not the 1st Street turning\nbasin.\nThe basin is hydraulically connected to the canal (with no bulkhead standing between\nthe canal and the basin) such that contaminants within the basin are an on-going source\nof contamination. Finally, unlike other filled in portions of former turning basins, the 1st\nStreet basin has no standing structures on it, thus making excavation to remove this\ncontinuing source a preferred option compared to other upland sites. Based on this\ncombined set of considerations, the EPA determined that the preferred approach for the\n1st Street basin is removal of the contaminated soil and restoration of the basin.\nAlternatives that remove or destroy hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants\nto the maximum extent feasible are key criteria for the effectiveness evaluation of\nremedial alternatives.\nV-127\nThe FS report addendum presented an example potential excavation and restoration\napproach with associated estimated costs. The costs are order-of-magnitude cost\nestimates that provide an accuracy of +50 percent to – 30 percent and are based on the\nquantities and assumptions in the presented potential excavation and restoration\napproach. A confirmatory investigation will be performed during the remedial design to\ncollect the additional data necessary to develop the final approach and design for the\nexcavation and restoration activities.\nThe principal benefit derived from the cleanup and restoration of the former 1st Street\nturning basin and the portion of the 5th Street turning basin beginning underneath the 3rd\nAvenue bridge and extending approximately 25 feet to the east is the mitigation of\nwetlands impacts that may be associated with the cleanup of the canal from a series of\nincremental intrusions into the canal from cut-off walls and/or bulkhead restoration work.\nRegulations relating to the filling of water bodies are Site-specific ARARs. As noted\npreviously, the State seeks to limit or offset encroachment on the canal when bulkheads\nare repaired. In its comments, NYCDEP noted with respect to other potential project-\nrelated wetlands impacts that “[t]he average cost for purchase of credits from a\nmitigation bank is currently approximately $700,000 per acre, or $21 million. This cost\nwas not included in the cost estimate for RTA 3” (NYC 2013, page 71). The EPA\nagrees that it is appropriate to consider and evaluate the cost of wetlands mitigation.\nThe excavation of the 1st Street turning basin offers several additional potential\nbenefits:\n Shallow water habitat restoration could be incorporated to establish vegetative\ngrowth appropriate for an urban setting.\n Flood storage capacity within the canal would be marginally increased.\n A boat launch can be constructed in the restored turning basin so that members of\nthe community can launch canoes or other shallow-draft recreational vessels.\n Public access to the canal may be increased.\nLike the main channel of the canal, the 1st Street turning basin is owned by NYC. Two\nmajor parcels abutting the basin, the Power Station and 420 Carroll Street, have\nrecently been purchased. If these properties are redeveloped around a restored 1st\nStreet basin, NYC’s waterfront guidelines suggest that the required esplanade area may\ninclude both the canal and basin frontage, resulting in more public open space. The\nEPA contacted these property owners in connection with the Proposed Plan to ensure\nthat they were aware of the proposed restoration of the basin. No formal comments\nwere submitted by these property owners with respect to the overall remedy or the 1st\nStreet basin restoration specifically.\nAs part of the confirmatory design investigation and throughout the design, property\nowners along the 1st Street turning basin will be contacted to coordinate the planned\nactivities.\nV-128\nDiffering Conditions Along Canal\nComment #191: National Grid asserts that the benefits of dredging all of the soft\nsediment in RTA 3B, as called for in the Proposed Plan, are disproportionate with the\nlocalized nature of the impacts and the disruption, associated worker and public risk\nfrom the construction, and extended construction duration. The remedy for RTA 3B\nshould be re-evaluated and less-intrusive alternative approaches including hot spot\nremoval and monitored natural attenuation should be considered, especially given that\nRTA 3B represents nearly 50 percent of all sediments slated for removal in the\nProposed Plan.\nNational Grid also asserts that the sediment chemistry is different in RTA 3 and\nsediments in RTA 3B contain lower concentrations of potentially toxic chemicals than\nmuch of the rest of the canal.\nResponse #191: The EPA has reviewed the data set cited in the comment concerning\ncontaminant distribution and hot spot and non-hot spot locations in RTA 3B. The total\nPAH distribution for hot spot and non-hot spot locations are presented in Figure 8,\nbelow. The EPA elected to divide the data sets in two depths: depths from zero to four\nfeet below the sediment surface and depths greater than four feet below the sediment\nsurface to match the depth intervals used by the commenter in their analysis. The basis\nfor this division was that in the near surface sediments exposure to benthic communities\noccurs and natural recovery could be expected to have a greater effect.\nPRG = 20\nmg/kg\nFigure 8: PAH Distribution for Hot Spot and Non-hot Spot Locations\nV-129\nThe data analysis confirms the comment that the non-hot spot locations have lower total\nPAH concentrations in the sediment in the top four feet compared to the deeper\nsediments at the same locations. However, the data also show that whereas the\nmedian concentration for the non-hot spot locations in the upper four feet of sediment is\nnear the PRG approximately 50% of the samples collected were above the PRG. All\nnon-hot spot locations at depths greater than four feet were also above the PRG. The\nabove analysis confirms the EPA’s previous conclusion that soft sediment removal is\nrequired in RTA 3B.\nThe EPA has already accounted for the different characteristics of RTA 3 relative to the\nother two RTAs by reducing the active cap conceptual layout for RTA 3 compared to the\nother two RTAs. This determination was based both on reduced groundwater discharge\nvelocity and NAPL impacts in RTA 3. The absorptive layer was reduced to six inches in\nRTA 3 compared to one foot in the other two RTAs. As stated in other summary\ncomment sections, the active cap design in the PRAP represents a conceptual design\nfor alternative development and not the actual remedial design. Different active cap\nconfigurations for RTA 3B will be evaluated during the remedial design.\nAlthough the EPA has characterized RTA 3 as the least contaminated, this is relative to\nRTA 1 and 2, rather than relative to background levels. The level of sampling, design\nand targeted removal costs, together with the risk associated with leaving untreated\ncontamination in place, as compared to full removal does not justify an altered\napproach.\nHydrology and Nonaqueous Phase Liquid Impacts in Remediation Target Area 3\nComment #192: National Grid asserts that the hydrology and NAPL Impacts are\ndifferent in RTA 3 and warrant different treatment than the other areas of the canal.\nResponse #192: The EPA agrees that the hydrology and NAPL impacts in RTA 3B are\ndifferent than in the other RTAs. The groundwater model provided by National Grid\nindicates that only 12 percent of the groundwater discharge into the canal is in RTA 3\neven though RTA 3 occupies over 50 percent of the canal bottom.\nNAPL impacts are also lower than other RTAs. Over 70 percent of the cores collected\nof native sediment showed no NAPL impacts and no NAPL saturated cores were\nobserved.\nThe EPA has already accounted for the different characteristics of RTA 3 relative to the\nother two RTAs by reducing the active cap conceptual layout for RTA 3 compared to the\nother two RTAs.\nNatural Attenuation for Remediation Target Area 3\nComment #193: The PRP Group and the Sediment Management Workgroup asserts\nthat natural attenuation should be considered for RTA 3.\nV-130\nResponse #193: The complex mix of contamination in RTA 3, which contains a very\nlarge number of chemical compounds resistant to degradation (as in the rest of the\ncanal) has arguably been subject to natural attenuation for an extended period of time,\npre-dating the Superfund process by over a century, with no indication that\ncontaminants will ever drop to acceptable levels.\nSediment Toxicity and Benthic Community Health in Remediation Target Area 3\nComment #194: National Grid asserts that sediment toxicity and benthic community\nhealth are different in RTA 3. The toxicity was not uniform throughout RTA 3B.\nResponse #194: National Grid has collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples\nthroughout the canal. Under the existing conditions of surface disturbance, the overall\nconclusion was that benthic macroinvertebrates were found at all locations sampled.\nThe quality of the community depended on the quality of the habitat and sediment type.\nThe EPA agrees that RTA 3B has more hospitable conditions to support a benthic\ncommunity than RTAs 1 and 2, but does not agree that monitored natural recovery\n(MNR) is an acceptable remedy for this section of the canal. MNR was screened out as\nan alternative for the lower reach of the canal since the accumulated sediments are\ngrossly contaminated with a broad range of pollutants that are unlikely to naturally\nattenuate and which may be subject to some degree of transport via propeller wash,\nstorms, and tidal action to areas of the canal that were capped.\nRemedy Effectiveness\nComment #195: A commenter suggested that the ROD aim for the highest cleanup\nstandards and apply and enforce those standards to the upland NYSDEC-managed\nsites, as well.\nResponse #195: Because there are no promulgated standards or criteria that apply to\nthe cleanup of contaminated sediments in New York, Site-specific PRGs for sediments\nin the Gowanus Canal were developed. PRGs are used to define the extent of cleanup\nneeded to achieve the RAOs. A “clean” surface will be established at the bottom of the\nGowanus Canal at the end of remedy construction.\nTo prevent recontamination of the canal following the implementation of the remedy, the\nupland sources of hazardous substances, including discharges from three former\nMGPs, CSOs, other contaminated upland areas and unpermitted pipes along the canal\nmust be addressed prior to the commencement of, or in phased coordination with the\nimplementation of the selected remedy.\nThe former MGP facilities are being addressed by National Grid under NYSDEC\noversight. Based upon the first NYSDEC-selected remedy at one of these former MGP\nfacilities and NYSDEC guidance for presumptive remedies at former MGP facilities, it is\nV-131\nassumed that a range of actions will be implemented at the facilities (that may include\nremoval of mobile sources, construction of cut-off walls along the canal and active\nrecovery of NAPL near the cut-off walls for each of the former MGP facilities) which will\nprevent the migration of contamination from the former MGP facilities into the canal.\nThe EPA and NYSDEC will coordinate measures to control discharges from upland\ncontaminated areas adjacent to the canal that have already been referred to NYSDEC\nfor action. In addition, under the selected remedy, unpermitted pipe outfalls will be\neither controlled or eliminated.\nSince CSOs to the canal will not be entirely eliminated as part of the sediment remedy,\nthe newly-established background level of PAHs in surface sediment will depend on the\nlevel of CSO reductions achieved. The goal is to reduce the contribution of CSO solids\nso that the average total PAH concentration in canal’s surface sediments after\nremediation does not exceed the PRG of 20 mg/kg.\nComment #196: National Grid asserts that remedy performance should be based on\npost- remedy operation of the canal and that appropriate performance measures and\nmonitoring plans to assess remedy performance in both the short term and long term\nshould be developed.\nThe Gowanus Conservancy asserts that remedy performance standards should\naddress historical sources, as well as CSO discharges and storm sewers. The\nperformance standards should be adapted as conditions in the canal change. The\nGowanus Conservancy also asserts that long-term performance monitoring should be\nclosely linked to the CSM so that the hypotheses and assumptions that led to the\nselected remedy can be tested and refined.\nResponse #196: Specific performance measures were developed in the Proposed Plan\nfor total PAH concentrations in sediment of 20 mg/kg (the PRG) and for surface water\nconcentrations (final chronic values-FCVs). The FCVs presented in the FS report and\nin Table 4, below, are considered performance measures for pore water near the\nsediment surface.\nTable 4: Final Chronic Values\nFinal Chronic Values for PAHs in Pore\nChemical\nWater (mg/L)\nNapthalene 0. 1935\nAcenapthene 0. 3069\nFluorene 0. 0393\nPhenanthrene 0. 0191\nPyrene 0. 01011\nV-132\nA performance monitoring plan to assess whether and how these performance\nstandards are met will be developed as part of the remedial design.\nIn addition, because contaminants are left in place beneath the cap (treated by ISS or\nleft without treatment) following the implementation of the remedy, five year reviews will\nbe performed to assess whether the remedial goals are being achieved.\nDredging and Sediment Management Costs\nComment #197: NYCDEP asserts that the dredging and sediment management costs\nconsistently underestimate likely costs based on Site-specific conditions. The costs of\nimplementing the remedy are likely to be in a range that is twice those amounts, which\nis outside the acceptable tolerance for a CERCLA FS compared to the final remedy cost\n(i.e., -30 to +50 percent). Insufficient Site characterization and overly optimistic\ntechnical assumptions are used to justify the design concepts have resulted in an\nunderestimation of the probable costs for each of the alternatives.\nResponse #197: The EPA’s FS cost estimating guidance (EPA, 2000) states the\nfollowing (underlining added for emphasis):\nWhile cost estimates are developed at different stages of the Superfund process\n(Chapter 2), this guide specifically addresses the FS phase. Cost estimates are\ndeveloped during the FS primarily for the purpose of comparing remedial\nalternatives during the remedy selection process, not for establishing project\nbudgets or negotiating Superfund enforcement settlements. During remedy\nselection, the cost estimate of the preferred alternative is typically carried over\nfrom the FS to the PRAP for public comment. The subsequent cost estimate\nincluded in the record of decision (ROD) reflects any changes to the remedial\nalternative that occurs during the remedy selection process as a result of new\ninformation or public comment.\nThe guidance further states:\nAs a project moves from the planning stage into the design and implementation\nstage, the level of project definition increases, thus allowing for a more accurate\ncost estimate. An “early” estimate of the project’s life cycle costs is made during\nthe FS to make a remedy selection decision.\nAt the FS stage, the design for the remedial action project is still conceptual, not\ndetailed, and the cost estimate is considered to be “order-of-magnitude.” The\ncost engineer must make assumptions about the detailed design in order to\nprepare the cost estimate. As a project progresses, the design becomes more\ncomplete and the cost estimate becomes more “definitive,” thus increasing the\naccuracy of the cost estimate.\nWhile the -30 to +50 percent is the expected cost estimate accuracy at this stage, the\nguidance expressly notes that “the specific percentages correlate with generally\nV-133\naccepted rules of thumb for cost estimating accuracy and are not meant to imply that\nthese goals will be precisely achieved.”\nThe cost estimate developed for the FS and subsequently revised in the FS report\naddendum and used in the Proposed Plan is sufficient to support the selection of an\nalternative. The EPA acknowledges that as the remedy becomes increasingly more\ndefined during the remedial design, the cost estimate will change. These changes will\nbe reflected and documented in the 30 percent, 60 percent and final remedial design\ndocuments generated during the remedial design process.\nFigure 8, below, from the EPA’s FS cost estimating guidance (EPA, 2000) shows how\nthe accuracy of the cost estimate is refined during the different project stages.\nFigure 8: Exhibit 2-3, Expected Cost Estimate Accuracy Along the Superfund Pipeline, from the\nEPA’s Feasibility Study Cost Estimating Guidance\nOf the specific cost elements commented upon, the fundamental assumptions for every\nsingle element are the same for each of the evaluated alternatives, except for the costs\nassociated with in-situ stabilization, which are specific to Alternative 7. Any changes to\nthe specific elements listed would affect both alternatives to the same degree and, as a\nresult, the relative cost ranking would not change.\nThe selected remedy incorporates several approaches which should limit remedial\ndesign and remedial action costs relative to other sediment sites. The disposal volume\nis well quantified, and limited by the defined project area boundaries. Sediment\ncontaminant levels are also well defined. These conditions limit the purposes for which\nremedial design sampling will be required. Because full removal of accumulated\nsediments has been selected, and residual contamination is expected in native\nsediments, post-excavation confirmatory sampling will also be limited as compared to\nother sediment sites.\nV-134\nConfirmatory Design Sampling and Testing Costs\nComment #198: NYCDEP notes that the FS report assumed that pre-design sampling\nand testing could be performed for a cost of $500,000–including sample collection\nwhich is unrealistic. No details are provided regarding these activities. No information\nis provided regarding geophysical testing. Geotechnical analysis is not included in the\nestimate and this will be a major concern of the design process. Equipment\nmobilization/demobilization costs are not addressed in the estimate.\nResponse #198: Confirmatory design sampling and testing will be performed at the\nstart of design. The costs were estimated at $500,000 in the FS, but could be higher,\npotentially of the same magnitude as the remedial investigation costs.\nRemedial Design Costs\nComment #199: NYCDEP asserted that the remedial design costs are too low at four\npercent of remediation costs and are typically five to 15 percent of project costs.\nResponse #199: While the range of design costs cited in the comment (five to 15\npercent of project costs) is generally reasonable for typical projects, a lower percentage\nnear the lower end of this cited range (4%) was selected since the overall project costs\nwere relatively high due to the sheer volume of sediment that requires removal. The 4%\nwas not applied to the sediment transportation and removal costs and the ISS. If the\nassumption made in the FS is changed and the percent is applied to the sediment\ntransport and removal and ISS costs, the cost of the design would increase by\napproximately $6.5 million. A detailed estimate of the design costs will be prepared at\nthe start of the design.\nPre-Remediation Site Work Costs\nComment #200: NYCDEP asserts that pre-remediation Site work costs for fencing and\ntemporary roadwork do not appear to be applicable for work in the canal. Costs for\ntemporary docking facilities should be considered.\nResponse #200: The full details of the pre-remediation Site work will be developed\nduring the design when the process layout will be developed and specific locations will\nbe identified.\nDebris Management Costs\nComment #201: NYCDEP noted that debris management costs were not considered.\nResponse #201: For the Kinnickinnic River project (a mechanical dredging project\nconducted in an urban environment, from a portion of the river that had not been\nV-135\ndredged in 60 years), debris was processed and disposed off-site as part of the\ndredging operation. The dredging costs for the Gowanus Canal estimate used the\nactual Kinnickinnic River dredging costs as a basis, which included a debris screening\nprocess. Costs for off-site disposal of debris for the Kinnickinnic River were 0.1% of the\ntotal dredging costs and 0.04% of the total project costs. Debris from the Kinnickinnic\nRiver was disposed in a landfill, as opposed to the sediment, which was disposed at a\nconfined disposal facility. For the Gowanus Canal, for most disposal options, debris can\nbe disposed along with the sediment and does not need to be separated.\nTemporary Access Roads and Temporary Storage Area Costs for In-Situ\nStabilization\nComment #202: NYCDEP noted that the temporary access roads and temporary\nstorage area costs for ISS were not clear. The ISS process is subject to the same\nspace and other canal limitations and the production rate might need to be adjusted\nsimilarly to the dredging rate. Additional equipment might be needed to maintain the\nproposed ISS operations or delays might be incurred.\nResponse #202: These considerations will be analyzed in detail during the remedial\ndesign and detailed costs will be derived accordingly.\nSpace and Other Canal Constraints\nComment #203: NYCDEP asserts that space and other canal constraints impacting the\ndredging operations will also affect cap placement operations.\nResponse #203: These constraints will be analyzed in detail during the remedial design.\nWater Treatment System Proposed for Treating Water Within Temporary Sheet\nPile Cells\nComment #204: NYCDEP asserts that the water treatment system proposed for treating\nthe water within the temporary sheet pile cells does not have redundancy in\ncomponents, does not have excess capacity to treat decontamination water or surface\nrunoff and its operation does not incorporate downtime for media change out.\nResponse #204: The description of the water treatment system for treating the water\nwithin the temporary sheet pile cells is conceptual in nature. The components of the\nwater treatment system will be developed during the remedial design.\nV-136\nLong-Term Monitoring and Maintenance Program for Sediment Cap\nComment #205: NYCDEP noted that the long-term monitoring and maintenance\nprogram for the sediment cap does not address PAH contamination. It is unclear how\nthe assumed five percent replacement of the cap footprint every ten years will be\naccomplished. The need to replace the oleophillic materials in the cap has not been\naddressed; including costs for design and construction oversight, dredging of the canal\nto remove the old cap and accumulated sediment, and disposal of these materials, cost\nfor placement of new multi-layered cap could be approximately $200 million per round\nof replacement.\nResponse #205: The operation, maintenance and monitoring components of the\nremedy will be developed during the remedial design.\nPre-Design Investigation, Modeling, Treatability Testing and Pilot Testing\nComment #206: National Grid, NYCDEP and the Sediment Management Workgroup\nstated that additional studies are needed to finalize the remedy and to support the\nremedial design. The specific studies noted to be needed include navigational studies,\ngroundwater modeling, hydrodynamic modeling, geotechnical investigations, cap design\nand performance studies, performance standards evaluation, dredging production and\nthroughput evaluation, contaminant release studies, sediment re-suspension and\ncontaminant release control evaluations, operations plan, monitoring and management\nplan, field pilot studies, handling and transport study, sediment treatability studies,\nbeneficial use studies, landfill investigation and others.\nResponse #206: While the EPA believes that it is appropriate to complete such studies\nand plans prior to implementation of the remedy, there is sufficient information at this\ntime to move forward with remedy selection. As is customary, additional confirmatory\ndata gathering, evaluations and plans will be completed during the remedial design.\nThe remedial design phase will begin with the identification of the data needed to\nsupport the specifics of the design.\nAdaptive Management\nComment #207: National Grid commented on the need for an adaptive management\napproach resulting from remaining uncertainties regarding specific design requirements\nfor remedy components, such as for example dredging, capping, and sediment\ndisposal. It was noted that the ROD should contain language that allows for the\napplication of alternative methods and techniques that are acceptable to the EPA. It\nwas further commented that the ROD should be flexible enough to allow application of\nsuch potential alternatives and allow for real-time modification of the remedy even while\nit is being implemented. Such an adaptive management approach will enable the\nparties to work together to design an appropriate and sustainable remedy.\nV-137\nIt was noted that, going forward, the EPA should utilize an adaptive management\napproach consistent with the Adaptive Management Technical Guide published by the\nU. S. Department of Interior. This technical guide describes adaptive management as\nan \"iterative process of management, monitoring, and evaluation\" that \"actively engages\nstakeholders in all phases of a project over its timeframe, facilitating mutual learning\nand reinforcing the commitment to learning-based management.\" Adaptive\nmanagement also involves \"ongoing, real-time learning and knowledge creation\" with\nthe objective of achieving an \"improved understanding and improved management over\ntime.\nResponse #207: The EPA is committed to an adaptive management approach during\nthe implementation of the remedy for the Gowanus Canal. Confirmatory investigations\nwill be performed during the remedial design in order to collect additional data on which\nto base the design specifics. For example, the Proposed Plan provided a conceptual\ndesign for the active cap that included a 6-inch or one-foot adsorptive layer. Final\ndetermination on the active cap configuration will be made during the design based on\nthe additional collected data.\nFrom the start of the project, the EPA has consistently informed and provided multiple\nopportunities for meaningful input to the community and stakeholders. The EPA\ncontinues to be committed to involving and working closely with the community and\nstakeholders, throughout the project's design and construction phases. The EPA is\ncommitted to keeping the public informed of the progress of the remedial design and\nremedial action activities.\nRetention Tank Community Effects\nComment #208: NYCDEP states that community effects of belowground tanks for CSO\ncontrols were not considered.\nResponse #208: As mentioned in previous responses, NYCDEP has already built and\noperates below-ground CSO storage tanks and facilities in NYC with no adverse effects\nto the surrounding communities.\nCommunity Involvement\nComment #209: A commenter noted that the EPA has been actively engaged with the\npublic at this Site. The commenter asked what future communications with the\ncommunity can be expected after the ROD is signed.\nResponse #209: The EPA is fully committed to continue the same level of interaction\nwith the community as in the past throughout the design and remediation process.\nWhile formal public comment is limited under the Superfund process to the Proposed\nPlan and selected legal settlements, the EPA intends to continue to be publicly available\nand to seek the community’s valued input. The EPA’s ultimate goal is a protective\nremedy which is informed by the input of and beneficial to all of the interested\nstakeholders.\nV-138\nComment #210: A commenter asked whether or not Site-related documents are\navailable to the public.\nResponse #210: At every Superfund site, the EPA establishes information repositories\nto provide the public access to supporting documentation. Copies of supporting\ndocumentation for the Site are available on-line at http://www.epa.gov/\nregion02/superfund/npl/gowanus/ and at three information repositories: Carroll Gardens\nLibrary, 396 Clinton St., Brooklyn, NY; Joseph Miccio Community Center, 110 West 9th\nStreet, Brooklyn, Nandi the EPA-Region II Superfund Records Center, 290 Broadway,\n18th Floor, New York, NY.\nComment #211: Two commenters asked how public comment is considered in the\nremedy selection process.\nResponse #211: The EPA relies on public input to ensure that the concerns of the\ncommunity are considered in selecting an effective remedy for each Superfund site.\nCommunity input is one of nine evaluation criteria the EPA uses to evaluate site\nremedies. The EPA does not select a remedy until after considering all of the\ncomments that are received during the public comment period.\nComment #212: Two commenters asked whether or not there would be additional public\nmeetings during the comment period.\nResponse #212: Follow up meetings were held with the CAG on February 11, 2013, the\nRed Hook community on February 13, 2013, the residents of public housing located\nimmediately north of the canal on March 27, 2013, the Red Hook community on April\n16, 2013, the CAG on April 23, 2013 and the residents of public housing in Red Hook\non April 25, 2013 to further engage the community in conversation about the details of\nthe proposed cleanup plan.\nComment #213: A commenter asked that the EPA provide a well-publicized proposed\ncleanup schedule and a tentative community/EPA meeting schedule. Another\ncommenter requested that local residents and other stakeholders receive notification of\nthe EPA's expected timeline for the project and of potential meeting and feedback\nopportunities. A third commenter stated that the CAG proposed that a local public\ninformation center be provided.\nResponse #213: From the start of the project, the EPA has consistently informed and\nprovided multiple opportunities for meaningful input to the community and stakeholders.\nThe EPA continues to be committed to involving and working closely with the\ncommunity and stakeholders, throughout the project's design and construction phases.\nThe EPA is committed to continue to keep the public informed as to what is going on\nand what is planned at the Site via its website and community meetings. The EPA will\nconsider the establishment of a local public information center.\nV-139\nComment #214: A commenter complained that contradictory and confusing information\nwas disseminated by the EPA with respect to the planned construction of a waste\ntreatment/dewatering facility in Red Hook.\nResponse #214: Due to the technically complex issues at the Site, the EPA greatly\naugmented its interaction with the community beyond what is typical for the Superfund\nremedy selection process. The intent of the two public meetings and the follow up\nmeetings was to clarify the issues in a clear and concise manner. The EPA also met\nwith the CAG, which is composed primarily of local community group representatives\nwhose role in part is to disseminate information to their groups. The EPA also provided\ndocumentary materials on our website.\nIn the Proposed Plan, the EPA proposed a potential location for dewatering the dredged\nsediments and for stabilizing the sediments. As was noted at several of the public\nmeetings and follow up meetings, the specific details related to the dewatering and\ntreatment processes, such as its location, will be determined during the remedial\ndesign.\nComment #215: Several commenters expressed concern that the large Spanish-\nspeaking population that lives in the Gowanus area is mostly uninformed and\nuninvolved in the cleanup process due to the language barrier. Another commenter\nexpressed concern that many of the Spanish-speaking residents were not aware of the\nfact that the levels of contamination in the canal pose serious health risks. Several\ncommenters requested that the EPA ensure that the Hispanic and Latino residents and\nbusinesses have equal opportunity and access to information about the Superfund\npublic processes and have the opportunity to participate in the planning discussions and\nmeetings involving the future of the neighborhood. The commenters expressed a desire\nfor more direct outreach and engagement during the design and implementation\nphases.\nResponse #215: Flyers in Spanish announcing the January 23 and 24, 2013 public\nmeetings were distributed and fact sheets in Spanish were provided at the meetings. In\naddition, simultaneous Spanish translation was provided at both public meetings.\nDespite posted warnings, the canal is regularly used for fishing, particularly subsistence\nfishing by several separate EJ communities surrounding the canal. The fact sheets (in\nboth Spanish and English) that were distributed at the above-noted public meetings\nstated “the EPA recommends that the public avoid direct contact with canal water and\nsediment due to risks from exposure to toxic chemicals, and the risk from exposure to\nelevated levels of bacteria carried in the sewage from CSOs. No one should eat any\nfish or crab from the canal.” The EPA has also provided dual-language risk information\non its website. The EPA has also sought to have the CAG include representative\nmembers of a broad range of constituencies.\nThe EPA believes that the selected remedy will reduce risks to these communities by\nreducing sources which contribute to these risks. Because the selected remedy will not\nfully eliminate the need for fishing advisories due to contaminants from New York\nV-140\nHarbor, the EPA intends to continue to coordinate fishing advisory education and\nawareness efforts with the appropriate governmental agencies.\nThe EPA will continue to engage the entire community throughout the design and\nimplementation phases of the project.\nComment #216: A commenter stated that Red Hook residents have not had significant\ninvolvement in the Gowanus Canal Superfund process or the CAG until very recently\nand therefore, has had limited opportunity to develop a trusting relationship with the\nEPA. The commenter also stated because of the Red Hook community’s late\ninvolvement, the residents were surprised to learn that a CDF was proposed for their\ncommunity.\nResponse #216: The EPA sought to have the CAG include representatives from a\nbroad range of constituencies to ensure that Red Hook and other neighborhoods are\nengaged in the process.\nThe EPA also held meetings in Red Hook to increase awareness in that community.\nThe draft FS report, which identified a CDF option, was released to the public in\nDecember 2011. The EPA held an informal Red Hook meeting on January 19, 2012 for\nrepresentatives of various Red Hook community organizations. At this meeting the\nconcept of the CDF was discussed and it was noted that two locations were under\nconsideration–the 4th Street turning basin or in Red Hook. A public meeting to discuss\nthe results of the FS was held on January 24, 2012. The CDF was discussed at this\nmeeting and the two proposed locations under consideration were also noted. The EPA\nheld an informal informational meeting for the Red Hook community on March 22, 2012\nto discuss the FS and the CDF.\nTo ensure the Red Hook community’s participation in the Proposed Plan process, one\nof the two initial public meetings to discuss the proposed remedy was held in Red Hook\nin an attempt to bolster the Red Hook community’s participation. In response to\nquestions and concerns from the Red Hook community, the EPA returned for additional\npublic meetings in Red Hook on February 13, 2013, April 16, 2013 and April 25, 2013.\nComment #217: A commenter requested that the EPA’s Gowanus Canal EJ\nAssessment and Community Involvement Plan (CIP) be shared with the CAG prior to\nthe finalization of the ROD to ensure that the current and upcoming community needs\nare addressed and to ensure that a preliminary burden analysis is performed that takes\ninto account the impact of the retention tank(s), as well as the possible CDF or\ndewatering in Red Hook or Sunset Park, and the environmental burdens that could\nresult to these particular communities.\nResponse #217: The EPA provided a draft CIP to the CAG on August 27, 2013 so that\nthe CAG could assess whether the community’s concerns have been adequately\ncharacterized. The draft CIP includes the EJ Assessment. The EPA made revisions to\nthe CIP in September 2013 based on the community input.\nV-141\nComment #218: Friends of Community Board Six, Inc. commented that in considering\nthe proposed remedial alternatives and the lack of access to professional and objective\ntechnical assistance for members of the community has become a significant constraint.\nThe group requested a written response to its Technical Assistance Grant (TAG)\napplication. The TAG would provide funding that would give the community access to\nsuch resources.\nResponse #218: The EPA conducted a number of meetings with the public and the\nCAG to explain various aspects of the remedy. The EPA also provided technical\nassistance to the community through “Technical Assistance Services for Communities”\n(TASC)27 technical advisors. The technical advisors reviewed the EPA’s RI/FS reports\nand provided the CAG with reports with a focus on issues raised by the CAG.\nA letter was sent to the Friends of Community Board Six, Inc. on August 12, 2013\nindicating that based on the group’s ranking against the other applicants, it was not\nselected for the grant. The TAG was awarded to Friends and Residents of Greater\nGowanus in 2012.\nPost-Remediation Restoration\nComment #219: A commenter noted that the canal was originally constructed from a\ncreek to open the area to barge traffic, flush away sewage, receive stormwater and\ndrain the adjacent marshes for development. The commenter asked whether or not\nsome of the areas around the canal could be restored as wetlands to capture the water\nas it collects to prevent flooding.\nResponse #219: While extensive restoration of the wetlands is not possible since the\nvast majority of the shoreline of the canal is lined with retaining structures or bulkheads,\nthe EPA plans to include wetlands and to consider the use of soft shoreline edges in\nsuch situations where it may be possible and appropriate. The remedy includes the\nexcavation and restoration of the majority of the filled-in 1st Street turning basin, a small\nportion of filled-in 5th Street turning basin beneath the 3rd Avenue bridge and the\ndredging of the 4th, 6th, 7th and 11th Street turning basins. The EPA plans to consider\nsloped, wetland-style restoration for the 1st and 5th Street portions. It is possible that\nwetlands could be created at the terminus of the 4th, 6th, 7th and 11th Street turning\nbasins. During the design process, and in consultation with the PRPs and the public,\nthe EPA will also consider whether other areas may be appropriate for additional\nwetland areas. The flat topography is the dominant factor in how flooding impacts areas\n27 TASC provides funding for technical assistance to communities affected by hazardous waste\nsites. The funds are used to hire non-EPA experts to explain hazardous waste issues and\ninterpret the EPA’s plans for cleaning up that waste.\nV-142\naround the canal. As a result, the addition of minor areas of wetlands is unlikely to add\nsufficient water capture to provide any noticeable improvement.\nIt should be noted that NYCDEP is undertaking a green infrastructure effort28 that will\nresult in an estimated 10 percent CSO reduction in stormwater discharges to the entire\ncanal over an extended period of time (20-30 years). In addition, a pilot project for the\nGowanus “Sponge Park,” supported by federal and NYC grants, is currently under way\nfor the control of street runoff along the Gowanus Canal using green street ends.29\nComment #220: A commenter asked whether the installation of a barrier wall alone at\nthe former Fulton MGP State Superfund site will be sufficient to address the\ncontamination problem.\nResponse #220: A remedy has not yet been selected for the former Fulton MGP State\nSuperfund site. In order to comply with the EPA’s projected schedule for the\ncoordinated cleanup of the upland areas and the canal, National Grid, after consultation\nwith NYSDEC, agreed to accelerate the installation of a barrier wall at the facility as an\ninterim remedial measure (IRM). This IRM is likely to be one of several components of\nthe remedy that will ultimately be selected for the facility. While a barrier wall will\nreduce the migration of contamination from the facility to the canal, it will not remove the\nsources of contamination at the facility.\nSediment and Contaminant Mass Balance\nComment #221: NYCDEP asserts that a sediment and contaminant mass balance is\nneeded.\nResponse #221: Development of a quantitative sediment and contaminant mass\nbalance for the canal is not feasible or beneficial at this point. The canal is subject to\nconstantly changing inputs, which makes it difficult to precisely quantify sediment and\ncontaminant mass balances. Changes include the frequency, size and nature of storm\nevents; the ongoing development in the watershed and the variable Flushing Tunnel\noperations. Furthermore, broader changes in sediment and contaminant transport\nconditions in the canal may occur after implementation of the WWFP. In particular,\nrehabilitating the Flushing Tunnel will increase its average capacity by 40 percent, and\nreconstructing the Gowanus pump station and replacing the force main will reduce the\nannual volume of CSO discharges to the canal by 34 percent in a typical precipitation\nyear, while the CSO solids load at the head of the canal (outfall RH-034) will increase\nby approximately five percent and still contribute 97 percent of the CSO solids load to\nthe upper reach of the canal. These improvements are scheduled to be completed in\n28 A network of open spaces and natural areas, such as rooftop gardens and vegetated swales,\nwhich naturally manage stormwater, thereby reducing storm runoff into the storm sewers.\n29 Green street ends employ vegetation planted between the end of the street and the canal to\nprevent particulate matter and oils from discharging into the canal.\nV-143\n2014. While the net effect of these changes can be best quantified after the\nimprovements are completed, other planned and anticipated storm sewer separation\nand redevelopment projects thereafter will continue to alter the CSO loadings, creating\na steadily moving and variable baseline condition.\nThe EPA’s review of the existing record regarding the canal resulted in a conclusion\nconsistent with NYCDEP’s prior findings, that extensive data and studies had been\nperformed:\n“The City has been studying the CSO problems in Gowanus Canal for decades.”\n(NYCDEP, 2008, Appendix H, page 12).\n“As part of the Gowanus Canal and Bay Ecological Restoration Project and other\nenvironmental studies, extensive environmental sampling has been conducted in\nthe Canal to evaluate the quality of sediments.” NYCDEP, 2009, page 7.\nAs noted elsewhere, the EPA has reviewed modeling reports developed by the USACE,\nNYCDEP and National Grid relating to the various aspects of transport to and within the\ncanal. NYCDEP has, to date, declined to provide its model to the EPA. The EPA\nbelieves that more than adequate information has been collected, to date, upon which\nto base a remedial decision and to move in a timely manner to address the potential\nhuman health and ecological risks. As NYCDEP noted with respect to its 2009 proposal\nfor a Superfund alternative cleanup plan:\nThe entire lifecycle of the project through remedial construction completion would\ntake just over nine years, significantly shorter than the average New York State\nSuperfund listing. The City believes that the critical advantage of the shorter\ncleanup provided by the Alternative Cleanup Plan will be sooner elimination of\npotential human health and environmental exposures. NYCDEP, 2009, page 31.\nFor purposes of its Proposed Plan comments, NYCDEP has performed a simplified\nchemical mass balance calculation that attempts to reflect the observed surface\nsediment contaminant levels in the upper reach of the canal by mathematically “mixing”\nvarious ratios of contaminant concentrations in CSO solids and suspended sediments\nfrom Upper New York Harbor. NYCDEP argues that the lack of agreement between\nobserved and modeled surface sediment concentrations indicates that “there is no\ncorrelation between sediment inputs and contaminant burden in the canal.” As noted\npreviously, the EPA does not agree that the lack of a good fit between a simplified\ncalculation and observed surface sediment concentrations in the upper canal indicates\nthat CSOs do not have a substantial influence on sediment quality, or that there is no\ncorrelation between sediment inputs and the contaminant load in the canal. The more\nlikely explanation for the lack of agreement is that this calculation is not adequate for\npredicting the contaminant distribution patterns in this type of setting. The chemical\nmass balance calculation relies on several key assumptions that are not likely to be\nvalid for the Gowanus canal setting, including the assumptions that (1) the average\nconcentration of each contaminant on CSO and harbor solids does not change over\ntime; (2) the average concentration of each contaminant measured in CSO and surface\nV-144\nwater samples accurately represents a long-term average; (3) the relative contributions\nof CSO solids and harbor solids to the upper reach of the canal do not change over\ntime, and (4) no post-depositional chemical, physical or biological weathering or\ndegradation take place after the solids are deposited. The continuously changing\nconditions in the Gowanus Canal watershed and the variability in the CSO and Flushing\nTunnel discharges create complex conditions that are not easily modeled, particularly\nby the simplified chemical mass balance calculation used by NYCDEP.\nRelative Magnitude of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Sources\nComment #222: NYCDEP and National Grid noted that there are uncertainties in\ndetermining the relative magnitude of PAH sources and identifying specific sources of\nthe PAHs found in surface sediments.\nResponse #222: The EPA has identified a number of sources of PAHs to the canal,\nincluding the former MGP facilities, CSOs, unpermitted outfalls, contaminated\ngroundwater discharge from upland sites other than the former MGP facilities and\nstormwater runoff. These sources need to be controlled as part of the remedy.\nIn August 2012, National Grid collected sediment cores to a depth of four feet in the\nupper reach of the canal north of Union Street, as well as from the areas adjacent to\nCSO outfalls RH-035 and OH-007 in the middle reach of the canal and RH-031 in the\nlower reach. Sediment samples from the cores were analyzed for a variety of chemical\nconstituents. The sample results, which were reviewed by the EPA and include an\nanalysis of the nature of the PAH mixtures in the samples, indicate that the PAHs in the\nshallow sediments (top two feet) in the upper reach of the canal, which is the layer most\nheavily impacted by CSO solids relative to other sources of contamination, originate\nfrom a mix of petrogenic (petroleum related) and pyrogenic (combustion-related)\nsources. A mix of PAHs from petrogenic and pyrogenic sources is also seen in the\ncores collected near the CSO outfalls in the middle and lower reaches of the canal, with\nconsiderable variation between individual samples and cores. These results indicate\nthat the shallower (top two to four feet) sediments near the CSO outfalls are not\ndominated by tar-related (pyrogenic) contamination from the former MGP facilities, but\nrather contain a mix of PAH types from various sources. Given the complexity of and\nvariation in PAH mixtures in different parts of the canal and the complexity of the Site\nsetting, it would be nearly impossible to quantify the contribution of PAHs from each\nsource. Although the information on the mix of PAHs in the sediment is useful for\nidentifying sources that need to be controlled in order to ensure the sustainability of the\nremedy, these contributions do not need to be quantified in order to select a remedy for\nthe canal sediments. The selected remedy includes measures to address each of the\nsources.\nAs discussed in an earlier response, the mass of PAHs transported into the canal by\ngroundwater discharge is considered to be low compared to other sources.\nNevertheless, upland sites with the potential for discharging contaminated groundwater\nto the canal have been referred to and will be investigated by NYSDEC as part of the\nsource control strategy. Furthermore, unpermitted pipes will be either sealed or\npermitted as part of the remedy and, therefore, their contributions need not be\nV-145\nquantified. Finally, direct runoff is considered to be a less significant contaminant\ntransport pathway for PAHs and other contaminants to the canal compared to CSOs\nand the former MGP facilities (only six percent of the watershed is unsewered and the\nland surrounding the canal is relatively level.)\nBathymetric Change Analysis\nComment #223: NYCDEP noted that there is uncertainty in the analysis of bathymetric\nchanges in the upper canal from 2003 to 2010\nResponse #223: The EPA’s 2010 bathymetric survey and analysis presented in the RI\nreport indicates that the shallow sediments (top one to three feet) in the upper reach of\nthe canal (north of 3rd Street) were recently deposited (i.e., after the 2003 bathymetric\nsurvey). The details regarding the methodology used to compare the two surveys and\nthe limitations of the comparisons are provided in Appendix B of the RI report. The\ncombined error of the 2003 and 2010 surveys used in the analysis was determined to\nbe as high as +0.6 feet, with greater uncertainty in shoreline areas and less uncertainty\nalong the centerline or deepest part of the channel. The elevation changes between\nSackett and 3rd Streets in the upper canal were on the order of one foot to greater than\nthree feet, which are higher than the uncertainty of the surveys (elevation changes\nwithin +0.6 feet were not quantified). Although the level of certainty varies by location in\nthe canal, the objective of the bathymetric change analysis was to broadly characterize\nelevation changes within each reach of the canal rather than determine changes on a\nsmall-scale (i.e., location-specific) basis.\nVessel Activity as Sediment Transport Mechanism\nComment #224: NYCDEP questioned whether vessel activity in the middle reach of the\ncanal was sufficient to explain the lack of sediment accumulation.\nResponse #224: The RI/FS attributed the lack of sediment accumulation in the middle\nreach of the canal between 2003 and 2010 to sediment re-suspension and redistribution\nby propeller wash from vessel activity. The Vessel Impacts Study completed by\nNational Grid in December 2012 concluded that sediments were regularly mobilized into\nthe water column by vessel activity in the middle reach of the canal due to changes in\nflow patterns and velocities around tugs and barges, propeller wash and vessel\ngroundings. The number of vessel trips into the canal from 2008 to 2012 was estimated\nat 376 to 532 trips per year, and evidence of vessel disturbance on the sediment bed\ncan be seen in the high resolution multibeam bathymetric surveys performed by\nNational Grid in 2010 and 2011. This detailed information confirmed and expanded the\ninterpretation provided in the RI/FS and will be incorporated into the refined CSM for the\ncanal.\nNonaqueous Phase Liquid Migration Estimates\nComment #225: NYCDEP and the PRP Group assert that NAPL loading estimates\nshould be developed.\nV-146\nResponse #225: NAPL mass transport rates are difficult to obtain in this particular\nsetting and will vary substantially throughout the canal. NAPL beneath the canal bottom\nexists as a separate phase from the groundwater and flows as a separate phase along\npreferential pathways. Certain conservative design assumptions will have to be made\nfor different areas within the canal based on specific data collected within a particular\narea. These design assumptions will be refined as the CSM evolves through additional\ndata during the remedial design. NAPL source removal and containment walls have\nbeen selected for the Public Place former MGP facility. These measures should\neliminate lateral NAPL flow and may also reduce flow from beneath the canal by\ndecreasing NAPL pressure. The EPA anticipates that similar control measures will be\napplied to the Fulton and Metropolitan former MGP State Superfund sites. Because it is\nnot technically feasible to excavate NAPL beneath the canal, a cap is the necessary\nand appropriate remedial approach for the canal bottom. The NAPL transport rate from\nbeneath the canal is, therefore, only relevant to the design of the cap, not to selection of\nthe cap as a remedial component.\nWatershed-Based Conceptual Site Model\nComment #226: The Gowanus Conservancy noted that a complete and accurate\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the entire Gowanus Canal watershed is needed in\norder to achieve a successful and sustainable remedy.\nResponse #226: The EPA’s CSM, which will be refined during remedial design and\nremedy implementation, considers the broader watershed perspective. Over 90 percent\nof the watershed is sewered and the CSO and stormwater conveyance systems are\nintegral to remedial planning. The operations of the Flushing Tunnel, which connects\nthe canal to Upper New York Bay, are also an important component of the CSM and\nremedial planning efforts. The new “background” sediment and water quality conditions\nthat will be established in the canal after the remedy implementation are directly related\nto the regional watershed and harbor conditions. A good understanding of these\nconditions is fundamental in achieving the RAOs.\nAs noted previously, the approach utilized in the selected remedy reduces the\nparameters which will need to be refined for the CSM. Full removal of the accumulated\nsediment eliminates this as a post-construction source of sediment transport. CSO\nsolids control measures, combined with the work currently being implemented by the\nNYCDEP will significantly reduce CSO solids inputs. While suspended harbor\nsediments will remain at or near their current level, to the extent that such cleaner\nsediments continue to contribute to the capped canal bottom after construction, they will\ndo so at a relatively higher proportion than at present.\nBasis for Preliminary Remedial Goal Development–Ecological Toxicity Testing\nComment #227: NYCDEP commented on the usability of the whole-sediment toxicity\ntest data collected by the EPA for deriving valid PRGs. The concerns focused on two\ntest series that did not meet performance standards and, therefore, required re-testing.\nV-147\nIn addition, the need for re-testing raised concerns about extended holding times of test\nsediment.\nResponse #227: The EPA believes that the test series presented in the BERA and used\nto derive PRGs is valid and that the data can be used for determining sediment toxicity\nin the canal for the following reasons:\n Toxicity test series are independent events and the performance of one failed series\ndoes not reflect on the quality of a subsequent successful test series.\n The amphipods used in the tests are not cultured in the laboratory, but rather field\ncollected. Although two tests did not meet performance standards, the third test was\nsuccessful. It should be noted that this third test used organisms collected from a\ndifferent location than the unsuccessful tests.\n Prior to running the successful test series, a reference toxicant test was performed\nusing the species from the new collection site to assure their overall health. The\nreference toxicant test was performed in accordance with the long-term average for\nthe laboratory, indicating the species were suitable for use in the tests.\n For the test series, the negative controls met performance standards.\nWhile the extended holding time for the sediment required by the re-testing adds some\nuncertainty to the tests results, the extended holding time did not invalidate the test\nresults for the following reasons:\n Sediments samples used for the tests were stored at 4oC in anoxic conditions per\nEPA (2001a, b) and ASTM (2010a, b) guidance.\n Sufficient sediment was available from the original collection event to be used in all\nre-tests.\n Guidance (EPA 2001a, b and ASTM 2010a, b) generally recommends that sediment\ntests be initiated as soon as practical and before eight weeks post collection.\nHowever, guidance (EPA 2001a, b and ASTM 2010a, b) also indicates that if the\ntoxicants are not labile (for example, ammonia or volatile organic compounds are\nlabile) and their chemistry is expected to be stable (as for example, for PAHs and\nPCBs), then extended the holding times beyond eight weeks may not be of concern.\nIt has been shown that some contaminated sediments can be stored at 4°C for up to\n12 months without significant alterations in toxicity (Tatem, 1988). Furthermore,\nPAH toxicity in freshwater sediment has been shown to be stable over several years\n(Mount 2011, personal communication).\nThe EPA has reviewed additional sediment toxicity test data that was provided by\nNYCDEP and considers the data, along with the EPA’s data, to be valid and\ninterpretable. Furthermore, the two data sets are comparable in their uncertainties.\nTherefore, the EPA considers that the data collected for the RI/FS to be representative\nof Site conditions and appropriate for use in developing PRGs.\nV-148\nPreliminary Remediation Goal Development Methodology\nComment #228: NYCDEP expressed concern regarding the definition of a reference\nenvelope relative to the derivation of the PRG for total PAHs from the EPA sediment\ntoxicity test data set.\nResponse #228: Sediment toxicity investigations historically have used a variety of\napproaches to classify a sample as toxic (causing adverse effect) or non-toxic\n(associated with no adverse effects). One approach is to compare site samples to a\nreference sample. This approach helps to evaluate whether or not toxic responses in\nthe site samples are due to site-specific or ambient regional conditions. For the canal\nBERA and PRG development, the EPA chose to use comparison of canal stations to a\nseries of reference stations from Upper New York Bay and Gowanus Bay. Matching\nreference stations to site stations for comparison can be problematic. Therefore, the\nEPA chose to use a “reference envelope” approach to differentiate between site- and\nnon-site-related toxic responses. A reference envelope represents the variance in\nreference endpoint response, which can be established in a number of ways depending\non the number of reference samples and endpoints (e.g., maximum or 5th percentile of\nresponses). For the canal BERA and PRG development, the “reference envelope” was\noperationally defined as the lowest result for the reference samples tested. For\nexample, the reference envelope based on survival is the lowest survival measured in\nthe reference samples. The approach was chosen based on the number of reference\nstations.\nThere are certainly other approaches to define a reference envelope, such as the\nmethod described in Ingersoll and others (2009). However, the EPA believes that the\noperational definition for a “reference envelope” used to develop the PRG for total PAHs\nis appropriate and not overly conservative.\nComment #229: NYCDEP expressed concern regarding the definition of the no-\nobservable-adverse-effects-concentration (NOAEC) and lowest-observable-adverse-\neffects-concentration (LOAEC) used in the PRG development.\nResponse #229: Some analyses define the LOAEC as the lowest exposure\nconcentration where the response is statistically different from the control response.\nFor the purpose of PRG development at the canal, the EPA defined the LOAEC and\nNOAEC based on the reference envelope discussed above. Two thresholds were used\nto derive PRGs from the sediment toxicity tests for the protection of benthic organisms.\nThe first threshold was the lowest response measured in the reference stations or the\nreference envelope. A second threshold was set as a response of 20% reduction\nrelative to control. The lower of these two was considered the LOAEC. The PRG for\neach endpoint was determined first by identifying the lowest concentration that was\noutside the lower of the two thresholds and then selecting the chemical concentration\nimmediately below that as the NOAEC. The selection of a NOEC and LOAEC\npresented in the FS report and FS report addendum was correctly done using these\noperational definitions of a NOAEC and LOAEC.\nAlthough there are other approaches for defining NOAECs/LOAECs and for deriving\nPRGs, the approach used in the FS report and FS report addendum to develop the\nPRG for total PAHs is appropriate and not overly conservative.\nV-149\nComment #230: NYCDEP commented on the use of statistical versus graphic\nestimation methods to derive a PRG for total PAHs.\nResponse #230: In developing the PRG for total PAHs presented in the FS report and\nFS report addendum, the EPA considered two approaches as potential methods to\ndefine PRGs. One was based on graphical estimation, using the “reference envelope”\napproach described above and one based on a statistical estimation technique. Toxicity\nResponse Analysis Program (TRAP) software, version 1.230 was used to attempt to fit a\nmodel to the data so that effects concentrations could be determined. In the end, the\ngraphical method was chosen over the statistical estimation due to the large confidence\nintervals estimated by TRAP.\nThere are other methods to model and estimate toxic responses, the strength of each\nmethod depends on a number of factors including the size of the data set, variability of\nreplicate response within a test, and the measured dose response relationship for a\ngiven contaminant. The EPA chose to use a graphical approach because, given the\nparticular data set in Gowanus Canal, the graphical approach provides a method for\nderiving a PRG for total PAHs that is appropriately protective and not overly\nconservative. Because of the sample size and the variability of the Site-specific dose-\nresponse relationships, there is uncertainty in the specific NOAECs and LOAECs\nidentified using the approach. The EPA chose to address that uncertainty by identifying\na range of NOAECs and LOAECs from the test series that bounded the operational\ndefinitions, and then calculating a measure of their central tendency (i.e., the geometric\nmean). In addition, TOC content was accounted for in the calculations given its\nvariability in the samples. TOC is a key parameter that influences PAH bioavailability.\nTherefore, the calculations were performed on an organic carbon (OC) normalized basis\nto address this variation. The geometric means of the potential OC-normalized\nNOAECs and LOAECs were calculated and then converted to a dry weight basis\nassuming the mean canal-wide surface sediment TOC concentration of 6 percent.\nAs discussed previously, the additional data provided by NYCDEP was reviewed and\nconsidered. NYCDEP presented alternative PRGs based on its data set using a\nstatistical approach, as well as different expressions of the growth and reproduction\nendpoints (while the EPA expressed reproduction as number of offspring per surviving\nfemale, NYCDEP expressed it as number of offspring per surviving adult.) When using\nthe graphical methods employed by the EPA to develop a PRG and the same\nexpressions of growth and reproduction, NYCDEP data yield PRGs similar to those\ndeveloped from the EPA’s data set.\nPreliminary Remediation Goals for Metals\nComment #231: NYCDEP questioned the need for development of PRGs for lead and\ncopper given the current geochemical conditions of the canal sediment.\n30 http://www.epa.gov/med/Prods_Pubs/trap.htm.\nV-150\nResponse #231: In the Proposed Plan, the EPA identified metals, in particular copper\nand lead, as potentially contributing to unacceptable ecological risks to benthic\norganisms. However, the EPA acknowledged that geochemical analyses (i.e., acid-\nvolatile sulfide/simultaneously extracted metals) indicated that these metals currently\nare not bioavailable. Following implementation of source control measures and the\nsediment remedy, sediment conditions are expected to change so that in the future,\ngeochemical conditions in the canal may not favor the formation of insoluble sulfides\nthat make these metals not bioavailable. Therefore, in order to assure the long-term\neffectiveness of the sediment remedy, PRGs for copper and lead are necessary to\nverify that the RAO for the protection of benthic organisms is achieved and sustained. If\nPRGs are exceeded, then toxicity testing will be performed to assess the potential risks\nto the benthic community. Given the uncertainty in the contribution of metals to the\ndegraded sediment quality in the canal, selecting reference conditions as the PRGs for\ncopper and lead as outlined in the FS report and FS report addendum is appropriate\nand not overly conservative.\nPost-Remedy Sediment Transport and Deposition\nComment #232: National Grid identified a number of specific aspects of sediment\ntransport and deposition that will be affected by the sediment remedy, including the\neffects of the post-remedy bathymetric profile on Flushing Tunnel effectiveness and\nsedimentation behavior, the possibility that enhanced sedimentation of organic-rich\nsolids will lead to low dissolved oxygen conditions, effects of navigation on ecological\nrecovery, effects of Flushing Tunnel flows on benthic habitat and effects of higher flow\nvelocities from implementation of some remedy components on sediment stability.\nNational Grid also noted:\n Canal hydrodynamics in conjunction with external factors like the Flushing Tunnel,\nsediment disruption by vessels and barges and CSO flows present significant\nproblems for the proposed remedy.\n Hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling indicates that solids discharged in\nCSOs after the remedy is implemented will settle out and re-contaminate the surface\nsediments in the canal, even with the Flushing Tunnel operational. Sand deposition\nnear the outfalls will continue (depending on their location) and fine sediments will\nbe redistributed and settle in deeper areas of the canal.\n The uncertainties related to the effects of the CSO reductions and Flushing Tunnel\nimprovements currently being implemented under the WWFP on sediment transport\nand deposition throughout the canal must be clarified and addressed prior to remedy\nselection because these effects have an impact on the recontamination potential.\nResponse #232: Baird and Associates, on behalf of National Grid, developed\nhydrodynamic and sediment transport models to evaluate the transport and fate of\nsediments under post-remedy conditions, including particle tracking to determine the\nlikely pathways of sediments over longer time periods. The preliminary modeling\nanalyses are useful and informative and the EPA agrees that modeling to better\nunderstand sediment transport and deposition under post-remedy conditions is a key\nV-151\ncomponent of the remedial design. However, it is not necessary to delay the remedy\ndecision so that hydrodynamic and sediment transport models can be further developed\nand refined. As indicated in the EPA’s 2005 Contaminated Sediment Remediation\nGuidance, “[m]anagement decisions must be made, even when information is imperfect.\nThere are uncertainties associated with every decision that need to be weighed,\nevaluated, and communicated to affected parties. Imperfect knowledge must not\nbecome an excuse for not making a decision” (EPA, 2005).\nThe hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling documented by National Grid\nillustrates some of the difficulties associated with developing a model for the canal that\nrepresents current and predicted future conditions. For one, since no information was\nmade available by NYCDEP on flow and solids inputs from the CSOs, the CSOs have\nnot been incorporated into the model. Also, the flow measurements used to calibrate\nthe model were taken while the Flushing Tunnel was inactive. Flow in the canal was\ndriven primarily by tidal pumping which results in relatively low flow velocities with\nportions of the canal being effectively stagnant. Therefore, the model could not be\ncalibrated or validated for the higher flows that are expected after the Flushing Tunnel is\nreactivated. Nevertheless, the preliminary modeling results are a necessary first step in\npreparing for remedial design which must consider the combined effects of CSO solids\nloads, canal depth, Flushing Tunnel flow, dissolved oxygen concentrations, benthic\nhabitat, and commercial navigation.\nAlternatives to Soft Sediment Removal\nComment #233: NYCDEP, National Grid and the Sediment Management Workgroup\nasserts that other viable remedial alternatives for the soft sediment were arbitrarily\neliminated because they were not subjected to detailed evaluation.\nResponse #233: Alternatives that included partial sediment removal were included in\nthe FS report. These alternatives were screened using the NCP criteria of\neffectiveness, implementability and cost. EPA guidance indicates that screening of\nalternatives is appropriate to “aid in streamlining the feasibility study process while\nensuring the most promising alternatives are being considered.” The three screening\ncriteria parallel the nine criteria for detailed alternative evaluation. Therefore, the\nscreening of these alternatives was consistent with the NCP and EPA guidance. The\nEPA considered that partial sediment removal would not be adequately effective or\nimplementable based on factors which include soft sediment instability, potential cap\nfailure, the degree of dredging needed for project implementation and future navigation\nand the preference for treatment of principal threat waste.\nDepth of Sheet Piles in Conceptual Design\nComment #234: NYCDEP asserts that that the depth of the sheet piles in the FS Report\nis not sufficient, referencing a “rule of thumb” for embedment that typically applies to\ncantilevered sheet piling (i.e., no lateral support from tieback anchorages).\nV-152\nResponse #234: The vast majority of the bulkheads along the canal consist of historic\ntimber crib-style structures. These bulkheads are roughly 10 feet wide (from canal edge\nback) at the surface, wider below grade, and filled with boulders and rubble. Due to the\nnature of their construction, the original bulkheads cannot be removed when upgrades\nare necessary. Collapses would occur, including where structures rest near or within\nthe width of the bulkheads. As a result, although newer appearing steel or timber\nbulkheads are visible along the canal, these new sections are typically built seaward of\nthe older structures. During previous studies performed in collaboration with NYCDEP,\nthe USACE determined that the historic bulkheads were eligible for listing on the\nNational Register of Historic Sites. The bulkheads will, therefore, remain in place for\nhistoric and structural purposes. Accordingly, when bulkhead replacement is discussed\nin the context of the canal remedy, this term refers to upgrades which will provide\nadditional support to the older bulkheads which will remain in place.\nIn limited circumstances at the canal, a completely new bulkhead wall may need to be\ninstalled that will need to resist lateral forces from ground surface to dredge line (a\nsituation where the “rule of thumb” may apply). For timber crib walls which make up the\nmajority of the bulkheads, the lower submerged timber cribbing is still intact and able to\nresist lateral forces, and just the upper portion (i.e., above low tide) has degraded. In\nthis case, a shallower embedment depth for the steel sheet piling could be justified.\nThe FS assumed that sheet piling will include tieback anchors. During the design\nphase, each section of replaced bulkhead will be designed to the specific conditions of\nthe location where the bulkhead is being replaced. The depth of embedment will be\ndetermined for each section of bulkhead to be replaced and will be based on multiple\nconsiderations specific for that section: soil strength, ability to develop tiebacks,\nseepage beneath the wall, and any physical constraints.\nIn-Situ Stabilization Layer for Additional Strength for Bulkhead Support\nComment #235: NYCDEP asserts that the purpose of the proposed ISS layer is to\nstrengthen the native sediment under the cap, which suggests that the native sediment\nis not competent; otherwise no ISS layer would be needed.\nResponse #235: The mixing of the proposed ISS layer is not intended to provide\nstrength for the native sediment (although that is certainly a secondary benefit), but\nrather to impede the upward flux of NAPL in select portions of the canal.\nActive Cap for Additional Strength for Bulkhead Support\nComment #236: NYCDEP asserts that the conceptual design assumes that the 3-foot\ncapping layer will provide additional support to the wall. While this may be true in the\nlong term, the critical time for wall stability will be during excavation of the sediment\nwhen the cap will not be in place.\nV-153\nResponse #236: The EPA agrees that the critical time for ensuring wall stability is\nimmediately following the removal of the sediment. The EPA anticipates that\nimprovements to or replacement of many sections of bulkheads along the canal will\noccur prior to remedy implementation through the EPA’s efforts to coordinate and\nexpedite bulkhead replacement regardless of the extent to which such bulkhead\nreplacement is required for the implementation of the remedy.\nDesign analysis will consider all stages and sequencing of construction, sediment\nremoval, and cap placement. If necessary, temporary support measures can be\nimplemented to prevent bulkhead movement during sediment removal and cap\nplacement.\nPipelines, Utility Crossings and Bridges\nComment #237: NYCDEP asserts that the conceptual design does not consider the\nnumber of pipelines, utility crossings, and bridges in the canal that will impact the ability\nto construct a bulkhead in the manner proposed.\nResponse #237: Crossings of pipelines and other utilities will need to be identified and\nspecifically addressed during the design and installation of bulkhead repair,\naugmentation or replacement. Bulkheads crossing utility lines will require design on a\ncase-by-case basis. Soldier pile/waler systems are often used to span a gap in a\nbulkhead made for a utility. The solder piles can typically be spaced far enough apart to\navoid conflicts with buried utilities. Following dredging and cap construction, backfill can\nbe placed against the bulkhead. Relocation of individual utilities can also be considered\non a case-by-case basis, but such relocations are costly and should be kept to a\nminimum.\nBridges are anticipated to be less of an issue because abutments for active bridges\nhave been designed and maintained so that they are not relying on the limited support\nprovided by soft sediment in the canal. If bulkheads adjacent to bridge abutments\nrequire repair or replacement, the transition between the two can be developed during\nthe design. If dredging below bridges shows the potential to undermine abutments,\nspecial designs may be needed.\nBulkhead Stabilization Tiebacks\nComment #238: NYCDEP asserts that the conceptual design includes tiebacks to help\nstabilize the wall. There are a number of locations along the canal where structures are\nlocated such that tiebacks cannot be installed. It is not clear that tiebacks can be\ninstalled at a suitable depth to stabilize the wall without major excavation on adjacent\nproperties.\nResponse #238: Evaluation of individual sections of bulkheads requiring repair,\naugmentation or replacement, and the means of providing the upgrade will be\nperformed as part of the remedial design. Placement of anchored tiebacks can be\nV-154\nhampered by issues such as locations of buildings, utilities, and unsuitable soils.\nSections of sheet piling can be designed for cantilever support, temporary internal\nsupport, or other methods, as specific Site conditions necessitate. Also, grouted tieback\ninstallation are typically drilled at an angle between 20 and 30 degrees (or as steep as\n45 degrees) from the horizontal, which can put them deeper in the soil than most\nsurface utilities, and the drill holes can be performed with relatively small equipment,\nfrom a barge, thus precluding the need for large excavations adjacent to the canal.\nLand- or Water-Based Construction\nComment #239: NYCDEP asserts that no information is provided as to whether\ninstallation would be land-based or water based. If land-based, there are a number of\nlocations where existing structures will impact access in portions of the Site. The FS\nrepeatedly states that the reason to dredge portions of the canal would be to allow\naccess to the upper reaches – what assurances are there that the bulkheads can be\ninstalled without first removing the sediment, undermining the integrity of the existing\nbulkheads. For land-based construction, it is not clear that the existing bulkheads and\nthe material behind the bulkheads are strong enough to support the equipment loads\nnecessary to construct a sheet pile wall.\nResponse #239: Equipment to be used for bulkhead repair, augmentation, or\nreplacement will likely be a combination of land-and marine-based equipment. Where it\nis not feasible to deploy land-based equipment, floating equipment will be considered. If\nfloating equipment requires removal of four or five feet of sediment in order to float the\nequipment , the existing bulkhead will be evaluated for stability following dredging. If\nnecessary, the bulkheads will be replaced incrementally, and the canal will be dredged\nin short segments to allow for bulkhead replacement.\nSheet Piling Installation Vibrations\nComment #240: NYCDEP asserts that the vibrations from sheet pile wall installation can\ndestabilize or damage surrounding structures if constructed on soft materials.\nResponse #240: Potential damage from vibrations during sheet piling installation will be\nassessed during the design phase and appropriate measures will be implemented\nduring construction. Design tasks could include:\n Noise and vibration background studies\n Surveys of nearby structures\n Vibration and noise limits specifications for different locations along the canal\n Vibration and noise monitoring specifications during construction\n Evaluation of the use of alternative hammers (such as a variable moment hammer or\nimpact hammer) during construction\nV-155\nBulkhead Historic Studies\nComment #241: NYCDEP noted that the Proposed Plan refers to a historical and\narchaeological study. One of the recommendations of the study was removal or\nstabilization of the timber cribwork bulkheads with documentation of sample bulkheads\nand potentially mitigation of the adverse effects of remediation. NYCDEP also notes\nthat the Proposed Plan also states: “Where new bulkhead construction is required,\nbulkhead configurations that are in keeping with the historic character of the setting\nshould be considered.” NYCDEP opines that sheet pile bulkheads are hardly in keeping\nwith the historic character of the setting.\nResponse #241: Evaluation of the need for bulkhead replacement will be a property-\nspecific activity to be conducted during the design phase and will integrate\nconsiderations from the performed historic survey.\nSteel sheet piles were selected as the representative technology for bulkhead\nreplacement in the FS report as it would be the most economical approach. Sheet pile\nbulkheads have been utilized previously at various locations along the canal.\nFor containment walls such as that selected as part of the Public Place former MGP\nfacility remedy and the interim remedial measure for the former Fulton MGP State\nSuperfund Site, both of which will be constructed by National Grid, a sealed bulkhead\nwould be inconsistent with drilling numerous holes into the bulkhead to affix a facing.\nSimilarly, at properties where active barging is conducted, the timber facing may be\ndamaged by vessels.\nSome modifications to a typical sheet pile installation could be made, where\nappropriate, such as use of timber facing consistent with the existing crib wall pattern on\nnew sheet piling. Cost and implementation issues may, however, limit the use of such\nfacing. In addition, based on the EPA’s most recent discussions with the State Historic\nPreservation Office regarding bulkheads, the use of imitation materials is generally not\nfavored. The appropriate combination of approaches will be considered for individual\nparcels during the design phase.\nCatastrophic Effects of Bulkhead Failure\nComment #242: NYCDEP stated that the implications of failure of a significant portion of\nthe bulkheads along the canal due to dredging operations can be catastrophic but are\ngiven little consideration in the FS. No evaluation was done assessing the potential\nimpact of reducing the depth of dredging on the need to replace the bulkheads.\nResponse #242: The FS assumes that improvement or replacement of bulkheads is\nnecessary to prevent failure as a result of dredging operations. Alternatives to steel\nsheet piling, or augmentation with other technologies to provide containment of any\nexisting contamination behind the bulkhead, will be considered on a property-specific\nbasis as part of the design.\nV-156\nThe selection of a remedy for sediments within the canal is not dependent upon\nperforming a detailed investigation and analysis of the bulkhead along each property\nalong the canal. This detailed analysis is typically part of the remedial design.\nPotential Releases from Behind Bulkheads\nComment #243: The PRP Group noted that the Proposed Plan does not explain how\nthe sediment remedy will deal with new releases of contaminants from behind the\nbulkheads that may occur if the sediment remedy is implemented before bulkhead\nreplacement or repair. The PRP Group also noted that the Proposed Plan does not\nindicate whether bulkheads are being considered in some areas as an engineered\nsource control structure.\nResponse #243: The groundwater model quantified the discharge of groundwater to the\ncanal. In areas of low groundwater discharge, impermeable barriers may be effective\nwithout significant groundwater mounding. If needed, treatment gates could be\nincorporated into the bulkhead wall design to funnel groundwater through the treatment\ngate, allowing for discharge of treated groundwater to the canal. In low impact areas,\npermeable treatment barriers could potentially be used to address groundwater impacts\nbefore discharge to the canal. The former MGP facilities constitute the major\ngroundwater impacts to the canal from upland sites. It is anticipated that the barriers at\nthe primary sources (i.e., the former MGP facilities) will be in place before the\nremediation of the canal commences from the top of the canal to the bottom. The\nremaining upland sites with much lesser groundwater impacts to the canal have been\nreferred to NYSDEC and the groundwater contamination will be addressed in their\nremedy selection. In the interim, measures will be taken to mitigate groundwater\nimpacts to the canal.\nIn some areas, mobile NAPL appears to be present in the cribbing of the existing\nbulkheads and in soils immediately behind the cribbing. In cases where such\ncontamination is severe and where it is located at elevations which could allow it to flow\nback into the canal, it may be necessary to design bulkheads to function as engineered\nsource control structures. This will be evaluated as the design process proceeds.\nResponsibility for Bulkhead Repair\nComment #244: NYCDEP asserts that the implications of failure of a significant portion\nof the bulkheads along the canal due to dredging operations can be catastrophic but are\ngiven little consideration in the FS report. No evaluation was done assessing the\npotential impact of reducing the depth of dredging on the need to replace the bulkheads.\nResponse #244: The responsibility for the bulkhead-related work will vary, depending\non the nature of the work required. In the absence of the dredging remedy, property\nowners are legally required to maintain their bulkheads in a structurally-adequate\nmanner and which does not result in soil or materials falling into the canal.\nNational Grid will be responsible for constructing any containment walls as part of the\nformer MGP facility cleanups; the depths of these designs should permit dredging to\nV-157\noccur. The EPA has conducted preliminary negotiations with developers and property\nowners who wish to upgrade their bulkheads at their own expense and are willing to\nconstruct deeper bulkheads which will not require temporary shoring. As noted\npreviously, the EPA intends to facilitate and standardize such work to the extent\npracticable in order to make it as cost-effective as possible. Between former MGP\nfacility-related and owner-related work, the EPA anticipates that a significant portion\n(25-40%) of the bulkheads may be upgraded at a cost which is outside of the selected\nremedy amount.\nIn early August 2013, a partial bulkhead collapse occurred at the Benson Metals facility\non Smith Street. On August 16, 2013, the EPA issued an administrative consent order\nfor Benson Metals to conduct a CERCLA removal action which will include, among\nother things, removal of the debris in the canal and construction of a upgraded bulkhead\nwhich will not require temporary shoring. The EPA is coordinating with the other\ninvolved agencies regarding this order, which may serve as a template for similar\nadditional bulkhead work.\nOn August 22, 2013, a partial bulkhead collapse also occurred at a facility adjoining\nBenson Metals, the Greco Bros. Ready Mix Concrete Co., Inc. The EPA has requested\nthat the owner submit reports regarding the stability of the bulkhead, and may enter into\nan additional administrative order for bulkhead repairs, if necessary. The EPA\nrecognizes the potential extent of the issue, which presents a problem regardless of the\ndepth of dredging in the selected remedy.\nFor the remaining parcels, the EPA anticipates that temporary shoring will typically be\nrequired. The purpose of the temporary shoring is to support the existing bulkheads;\nthe bulkheads will not normally be repaired. The PRPs will generally be responsible for\nthese remedy-related costs. It is possible that project-related work may cause damages\nwhich require repairs for which the PRPs will also be responsible. The EPA intends to\nwork with the property owners in cases where substandard bulkheads remain, and, if\nnecessary, with NYC and other agencies, to enforce the bulkhead standards. If the\ncontinued presence of such substandard bulkheads is judged to present a threat to the\nintegrity of the canal remedy, available CERCLA authorities and/or resources would be\nused as necessary to ensure their repair.\nCost Burden for Bulkhead Upgrade/Stabilization\nComment #245: Community Board Six noted that the capital costs should include the\ncost of bulkhead upgrade/stabilization, which is expensive. The PRPs should bear\nthose costs, and non-PRP property owners should not have to shoulder the cost of\nbulkhead work that is necessary because of the remedies selected.\nResponse #245: As noted above, the responsibility for the bulkhead-related work will\nvary, depending on the nature of the work required. In the absence of the dredging\nremedy, property owners are legally required to maintain their bulkheads in a\nstructurally-adequate manner and which does not result in soil or materials falling into\nthe canal.\nV-158\nIf a non-PRP property owner’s bulkhead is in adequate condition, that property owner is\nnot expected to bear the cost of temporary shoring which is necessary for the dredging\nor of any repairs for damage that may occur.\nIf any property owners wish to upgrade their bulkheads, the EPA will seek to coordinate\nand facilitate that work, as described above, in order to minimize the owner’s costs and\nstreamline the process.\nPlan for Minimizing Bulkhead Upgrade/Stabilization Disruptions\nComment #246: Community Board Six noted that the bulkhead upgrade and\nstabilization work has the potential to be extremely disruptive to existing property\nowners and businesses. Community Board Six asked about a plan for minimizing\ninterruptions to existing businesses and compensating for temporary relocations if\nneeded, business losses, and other undue negative economic impacts.\nResponse #246: The bulkhead condition and the associated upgrade and stabilization\nwork that will be required will need to be assessed on a property-by-property basis. The\ndegree of disruption will also vary accordingly. A limited number of businesses utilize\ncommercial navigation. These businesses will require the most coordination. The EPA\nanticipates that the majority of the temporary shoring and bulkhead work will be\nperformed from the canal; however, tie-backs and other work, including structural\nassessments, will occur on the property. As the dredging progresses down the canal,\nremedial work is not expected to occur in any location for an extended period of time.\nAs a result, most businesses should not experience significant operational disruptions.\nBusiness interruption compensation may be available in appropriate circumstances.\nThe EPA will work with the PRPs and the property owners to limit disruptions to the\nextent possible.\nUse of Soft Edges in Bulkhead Design\nComment #247: Community Board Six urged the integration of soft edges as an\nalternative to metal bulkheads wherever practicable, and the introduction of flora and\nfauna appropriate for the absorption of run-off and natural treatment of contaminants\nand toxins that may be present.\nResponse #247: The use of soft edges will be considered where appropriate. In\ngeneral, the structural requirements of the bulkheads and the configuration of buildings\nand structures limit the areas where soft edges can be implemented. Green street ends\nare more readily implemented, since these do not require the same structural\nconsiderations. The EPA supports the use of green street ends, which may be\nconfigured to tie into soft canal edges in certain areas. In general, construction of soft\nedges will require the voluntary cooperation of individual property owners. Soft edges\nas an alternative to metal bulkheads above an appropriate water level could be used\nwhere practicable with natural treatment systems installed to absorb, reduce or treat\nstormwater runoff. The EPA intends to review the use of soft edges in the restoration of\nthe 1st Street basin and the area of the 4th Street basin beneath the 3rd Avenue bridge.\nThe EPA will continue to interact with the stakeholders and community on issues\nrelating to bulkheads, including soft edges, during remedial design.\nV-159\nQuantification of Groundwater Impacts\nComment #248: The PRP Group and NYCDEP assert that groundwater impacts on the\ncanal have not been evaluated by the EPA and the flux of contaminants to the canal\nhas not been quantified.\nResponse #248: Based on the analysis presented below, contaminant discharge to the\ncanal through groundwater is low compared to other sources. NYCDEP and National\nGrid, provided estimates of the groundwater flux to the canal based on groundwater\nmodels. These two estimates agreed within 25 percent of each other, which is relatively\nclose considering two different groundwater models were used. A more detailed\nestimate provided the groundwater discharge based on the characteristics of each\nremedial target area.\nThe EPA reviewed the distribution of total PAH concentrations in groundwater in\nmonitoring wells that border the canal screened in the shallow or intermediate water\nbearing zones, which are the primary discharge to the canal, and pore water data\nprovided by National Grid. The monitoring well data exhibited a wide range of\nconcentrations, as did the pore water data. Histograms of the groundwater total PAH\nconcentrations illustrated that the data are not normally distributed and using the mean\ngroundwater concentration to calculate mass flux is not representative of prevailing\nconditions. Use of the median value would be more appropriate in this case.\nEvaluation of the range of pore water total PAH concentrations also indicated that using\na median total PAH concentration in conjunction with the groundwater discharge rates\nprovides a more representative estimate of the mass flux resulting from groundwater\ndischarge.\nEstimates of total PAH mass flux were calculated using both the median and mean\nconcentrations for each RTA (based on EPA data, which was comparable to that of the\ncommenter), and the RTA-specific groundwater discharge rates and pore water\nconcentrations provided by National Grid. The resulting estimates of total PAH\ndischarge rates to the canal are presented in Table 9, below, and exhibit a wide\nvariation ranging from 19 to 1,500 kg/yr. The mean groundwater concentration estimate\nis significantly higher but, as noted previously, the mass flux calculations performed\nusing the mean concentrations are not considered representative. The estimated mass\ndischarge calculated using the median pore water concentration is considered the most\nrepresentative of the four values. Median pore water concentrations represent the\nequilibrium PAH concentrations in near surface sediment associated pore water\nthroughout the canal and are indicative of what may actually be fluxing into the surface\nwater. Furthermore, the data set includes a wide range of pore water concentrations,\nand has appropriate spatial coverage, including several samples in the central, most\ncontaminated portion of the canal.\nV-160\nTable 9: Total PAH Mass Discharge Rates for Different Concentration Statistics\nConcentration Statistic Total PAH* Mass Discharge Rate (kg/yr)\nGroundwater Data – Median Concentration 49\nPore Water Data – Median 19\nConcentration**\nGroundwater Data – Mean Concentration** 1,500\nPore Water Data – Mean Concentration 130\n*Total PAH is the sum of the 16 priority pollutant PAHs and 2-methylnaphthalene.\n** Italics denote values determined using mean concentrations, which are not as representative as the\nmedian. Bold denotes most representative mass loading estimate.\nThe EPA’s analysis indicates that the total PAH discharge to the entire canal from\ngroundwater is in the order of 20 kg/yr. Given the relatively small magnitude of this\nrelease pathway, a groundwater remedy which includes extraction and treatment is not\nwarranted and would not be cost effective.\nThe EPA believes that the selected remedy contains an appropriate array of prioritized\nmeasures to address the array of sources at the canal, including the sediments, the\nformer MGP facilities, CSOs, and upland source areas to groundwater. The EPA has\ndeveloped a schedule to coordinate the prioritized implementation of the remedy. The\nEPA agrees that it would be beneficial to accelerate, to the extent possible, remedial\nwork to address groundwater source areas at National Grid’s former MGP facilities (of\nwhich NYCDEP owns Public Place and Thomas Greene Park), and at other potential\nupland sources areas owned by various parties, including NYCDEP (Hamilton Street\nasphalt plant).\nGroundwater Discharge as Source\nComment #249: NYCDEP asserts that groundwater discharge is the primary source of\nPAH contamination to surface water in the canal, as well as the entire sediment column,\nincluding the surface sediment.\nResponse #249: NYCDEP is using data which show PAH impacts in the surface water\nof the canal as a basis to attribute the impacts to the NAPL and groundwater discharge\nand to dispute that the CSO discharges are a contributor to surface water impacts. The\nEPA considers all three sources, NAPL, groundwater discharge and CSO discharges to\nbe contributors to of PAHs to the canal surface water. The selected remedy provides\ncontrols for all three of these sources.\nGroundwater discharge through sediment is unlikely to be a significant source of PAHs\nto the sediment because the total PAH discharge from groundwater is only in the order\nof 20 kilograms per year and cannot account for the high concentrations of total PAHs\nmeasured in soft sediment, particularly in the shallow soft sediments.\nV-161\nActive Capping to Address Groundwater Discharge\nComment #250: NYCDEP asserts that groundwater discharge will be insufficiently\naddressed by active capping.\nResponse #250: The EPA believes that the mass discharge of PAHs and other\nconstituents of concern in groundwater can only be effectively controlled by using active\ncapping. Treatment “gates” may be needed in the active cap design to allow for the use\nof replaceable media to control the contaminant discharge in high groundwater\ndischarge areas.\nGroundwater Discharge from Non-Former Manufacture Gas Plant Facilities\nComment #251: NYCDEP inquires as to how the impacted groundwater discharge from\nsites other than the former MGP facilities will be addressed.\nResponse #251: In order for the canal remedy to be effective, the groundwater\ndischarge from the former MGP facilities will need to be controlled. Impermeable\nbarriers along the canal are currently included in the remedial designs for the Fulton and\nPublic Place former MGP facilities. In addition, the remedy selected for Public Place\nincludes excavation and removal of major tar sources and collection of mobile tar at the\napproaches of the cut-off wall. It is anticipated that similar measures will be included in\nthe forthcoming remedy for the former Fulton MGP State Superfund site. Additional\nremedial measures for the Metropolitan former MGP facility are also being considered\n(see the section with responses to comments related to source control). Each of these\nformer MGP facilities may need to incorporate groundwater management mechanisms\nbehind the barrier wall during the remedial design.\nThe former MGP facilities constitute the major groundwater impacts to the canal from\nupland sites. The remaining upland sites with much lesser groundwater impacts to the\ncanal have been referred to NYSDEC and the groundwater contamination will be\naddressed in their remedy selection. In the interim, measures will be taken to mitigate\ngroundwater impacts to the canal.\nVariation in Groundwater Discharge Patterns\nComment #252: NYCDEP, the PRP Group and National Grid inquire as to how the\nvariation of groundwater discharge patterns to the canal will be addressed.\nResponse #252: Measuring variations in groundwater discharge patterns will be\nevaluated during the remedial design. National Grid has prepared a groundwater flow\nmodel that the EPA has reviewed. The model provides an overall summary of how\ngroundwater discharges to the canal and the results show that groundwater discharge is\nvariable along the canal with the higher discharge volumes and greater groundwater\nflux occurring in the upper reaches of the canal.\nAlthough the groundwater model provides an overview of how groundwater discharges\nto the canal, it cannot provide accurate details on the spatial distribution of the\nV-162\ngroundwater discharge. The EPA has already initiated discussions with a specialty\nvendor, SelkerMetrics LLC (http://www.selkermetrics.com) to provide DTS technology at\nthe canal. By precisely monitoring temperatures in sediment it is possible to locate\nwhere groundwater is seeping through sediments and into bodies of water. Recent\ndevelopments of this technology also allow groundwater discharge rates to be\nestimated. The aforementioned tests and measurements will be performed during the\nremedial design to accurately locate groundwater seeps and to more precisely\ndetermine discharge rates.\nImpermeable Barriers and Flooding\nComment #253: National Grid and the Gowanus Conservancy express concern that the\nimpermeable barrier walls proposed for bulkhead support will mound groundwater\nbehind the wall and will increase the potential for local flooding. These effects will be\nmagnified if climate change raises sea levels and increases groundwater levels.\nResponse #253: Impermeable sheet pile barriers were considered in the FS as a\nrepresentative option for all bank-stability related bulkhead work as described in Section\n4. 2. 5 of the EPA Guidance for Conducting Remedial Investigations and Feasibility\nStudies under CERCLA (EPA, 1988).\nThe specific type and design of the bulkhead improvements will be more precisely\ndetermined, for each area where improvements will be required, during the remedial\ndesign. Sheet pile barriers will likely be needed to address areas adjacent to significant\nupland NAPL and dissolved phase impacts, such as at the former MGP facilities. These\nbarriers may be augmented with groundwater extraction systems to prevent\ngroundwater mounding behind the barrier. In areas of low groundwater discharge,\nimpermeable barriers may be effective without significant groundwater mounding.\nBulkheads may be made permeable, where appropriate. On clean parcels, sheet piling\nmay have below-grade discharge openings. On contaminated parcels, where needed,\ntreatment gates could be incorporated into the wall design to funnel groundwater\nthrough the treatment gate, allowing for discharge of treated groundwater to the canal.\nIn low impact areas, permeable treatment barriers could potentially be used to absorb\ngroundwater impacts before discharge to the canal.\nGeneral Bulkhead Concerns\nComment #254: A commenter noted that years ago, when the canal was dredged,\nbecause the bulkheads were in such poor condition, the dredges could not remove\nsediment located within ten feet from the bulkheads on both sides of the canal. The\ncondition of the bulkheads has not improved. Since the remedy includes dredging of\nthe sediments in the canal again, the commenter inquired as to how all of the\ncontaminated sediments will be removed if the dredges will have to stay away from the\nbulkheads.\nV-163\nResponse #254: To allow the dredging of the contaminated sediments to be performed\nwithout constraints attributable to the integrity of the bulkheads, it is anticipated that\ntemporary sheet-piling will be required in locations where the condition of bulkheads\nwarrants additional structural support. The EPA also anticipates that several planned\nactivities will result in major portions of the bulkheads being upgraded. As part of the\nremedy selected for the former MGP facility at Public Place, National Grid is required to\nconstruct a bulkhead containment wall. As noted above, NYSDEC has also directed\nNational Grid to design a similar containment wall for the former Fulton MGP State\nSuperfund site. It is possible that a third such wall will be required for the former\nMetropolitan MGP facility. Redevelopment work, such as the Lightstone Group project,\nwill also involve bulkhead upgrades. Finally, a number of property owners have\ncontacted the EPA regarding their plans to upgrade their bulkheads. The EPA is\nworking with all of these entities to ensure that the bulkhead upgrades will be able to\nsupport dredging activities.\nComment #255: Two commenters expressed concern that carrying out the dredging\nremedy will have deleterious effects on the bulkheads throughout the canal area and\nthat the cost of replacing deteriorated bulkheads may be a burden that will have\nadverse financial impacts on numerous canal bank property owners. A commenter\nnoted that there is strong interest in how standards for bulkhead replacement and\nmaintenance will be promulgated, including bulkhead height and design, where soft\nedges are possible and where wetlands could be restored.\nResponse #255: As was noted in the prior response, it is anticipated that temporary\nsheet-piling will be required for dredging in locations where the condition of bulkheads\nwarrants additional structural support. It is also anticipated that a significant amount of\nbulkheads will be replaced as part of the former MGP facility cleanups and by\ndevelopers and property owners, reducing the amount of temporary sheet-piling which\nis needed.\nThe EPA believes that there are a number of locations where the bulkheads are so\ndeteriorated that they may fail when the temporary sheet-piling is removed after\ndredging. The cost of the temporary sheet- piling will be borne by the PRPs. In such\ncases, the sheet-piling will be left in place until the property owner replaces the\nbulkhead. The EPA intends to cooperate with NYC on inspection and enforcement of\nexisting NYC bulkhead maintenance requirements. To reduce costs for affected\nbulkhead owners, the EPA will facilitate the permitting approval, design and construction\nprocess with interested owners. As noted above, the EPA will consider soft edges in\nareas where this is suitable and appropriate.\nComment #256: A commenter noted that the replacement of a bulkhead at the western\nterminus of 5th Street illegally encroached upon the canal by ten to fifteen feet, creating\ntwo issues--the original canal bed in this area is now an upland area and the\nconstriction is adversely affecting the maritime industry.\nResponse #256: The EPA has referred the matter to the appropriate regulatory\nauthorities. Removal of such prior encroachment areas will only be considered to the\nV-164\nextent that it is necessary for engineering reasons in order to implement the dredging\nremedy.\nComment #257: A commenter expressed concern that the current bulkhead proposal\nwill further worsen the already congested canal by adding a third generation of\nbulkheads that will extend even further into the water. Another commenter requested\nthat any bulkhead replacement not infringe on the existing width of the canal waterway.\nFurthermore, states the commenter, all efforts should be made to restore the historical\nwidth of the canal where and when bulkheads are replaced.\nResponse #257: Other than in locations where bulkhead replacement will likely be a\ncomponent of the canal or former MGP facilities’ remedy, it is anticipated that bulkhead\nreplacement will not be part of the remedy, unless a substandard bulkhead is judged to\npresent a threat to the integrity of the remedy or in cases where deep cutoff walls are\nrequired to protect the canal from recontamination. Nominal bulkhead encroachment\ninto the canal will likely be unavoidable. The excavation of the 1st Street and a limited\nsection of the 5th Street turning basins will, however, mitigate the loss of surface water\narea as a result of new bulkhead encroachment into the canal. As noted above, the\nEPA acknowledges that encroachment may have occurred in areas such as the curve\nof the canal opposite Public Place. Removal of such prior encroachment areas will only\nbe considered to the extent that it is necessary for engineering reasons in order to\nimplement the dredging remedy.\nComment #258: A commenter stated that the remedy needs to integrate various\ncommunity plans into the design of the new bulkheads. For example, existing plans for\nnew residential developments include canoe dock and waterfront access proposals,\nwhich will require custom bulkhead designs (e g., steps to water access) and the canal\nremedy must be flexible enough to accommodate these proposals.\nResponse #258: The bulkhead approach in the FS report does not represent the\ndesign of the remedy. The FS report developed remedial alternatives which contain\nrepresentative technologies that may be used to achieve the RAOs. The installation of\nsteel sheet piling with tieback anchors was selected in the FS report as the\nrepresentative approach for bulkhead upgrades along the canal. As the remedy is\nimplemented, there will likely be specific sections and specific conditions along the\ncanal where an alternative approach will be appropriate. Specific designs for bulkhead\nsegments along the canal will be developed during the design phase.\nBulkhead-Related Geotechnical and Groundwater Modeling Studies\nComment #259: NYCDEP asserts that the lack of Site-specific data on geotechnical\nconditions and groundwater modeling in the canal prevent a realistic assessment of\nbulkhead replacement requirements. No geotechnical calculations are provided to\nsuggest that the system is capable of supporting the anticipated loads or whether the\nnative sediment is even capable of supporting the proposed sheet pile wall (i.e., is\ncompetent soil).\nV-165\nResponse #259: Pre-design investigations will be performed to obtain the detailed\ngeotechnical information necessary to support the specific bulkhead approach and\ndesign along the canal. Geotechnical information is already available from a variety of\nsources. Geotechnical investigations have been performed by National Grid and other\nparties, such as Benson Metals, who are contemplating bulkhead upgrades. National\nGrid has also performed groundwater modeling. National Grid has submitted the results\nof both of these efforts. The geotechnical investigations showed that the strength of the\nnative sediments is variable along the canal. The soil strength, together with the\nstructural elements of the bulkheads such as sheet piles, tiebacks, walers and depth of\nembedment, are all considered in bulkhead design. Overall, the data showed that the\nnative sediment is compatible for various bulkhead designs.\nNational Grid’s groundwater model quantified the discharge of groundwater to the canal.\nIn areas of low groundwater discharge, impermeable barriers may be effective without\nsignificant groundwater mounding. If needed, treatment gates could be incorporated\ninto the bulkhead wall design to funnel groundwater through the treatment gate,\nallowing for discharge of treated groundwater to the canal. In low impact areas,\npermeable treatment barriers could potentially be used to address groundwater impacts\nbefore discharge to the canal.\nBulkhead Replacement/Upgrade Evaluation\nComment #260: The PRP Group asserts that bulkhead replacement/upgrade\nevaluation must be integrated into the remedy prior to addressing sediments in the\ncanal and not deferred until the design phase because it represents a component\ncritical to the selection of an appropriate remedy.\nResponse #260: The EPA recognizes that bulkhead conditions are a significant public\nconcern and an important consideration for the implementation of the remedy.\nHowever, the bulkhead replacement/upgrade evaluation does not need to be completed\nprior to remedy selection. Bulkhead reconstruction is a well-developed technology in\nthe construction industry and can be readily addressed during the design phase and in\na sequential manner, as the remedy is implemented from the upper to the lower canal.\nAs was noted in the Proposed Plan, the EPA prepared a series of approaches to\ncoordinate and expedite bulkhead replacement. The EPA has held talks with the\nUSACE, NYSDEC and NYC about cooperative approaches to address bulkhead\nreplacement and restoration along the canal. To the extent that bulkhead replacement\noccurs, appropriate consideration would be given to bulkhead preservation, aesthetics,\nthe use of soft edges and wetlands mitigation.\nFor the replacement of bulkheads, other than the structural sheet pile bulkheads that\nwill be required for remedy implementation, the possible methods include a\nstandardized design and promoting coordination among interested owners to reduce\ntheir costs through economies of scale. Where replacement is not needed for purposes\nof the remedy, the EPA will seek to utilize a streamlined permitting approach to reduce\ntransaction costs and expedite approval. Where replacement is needed for\nV-166\nimplementation of the remedy, the EPA will apply the CERCLA permit exemption to\nfurther expedite the process.\nThe EPA has met with several property owners who are interested in replacing their\nproperties’ bulkheads. The EPA is developing a standard approach for performing such\nwork which would ensure that the bulkheads are upgraded in a manner consistent with\nthe canal remedy and the substantive NYSDEC requirements. This work would be\ncarried out under an administrative order with EPA oversight. Such an order can also\nprovide appropriate CERCLA liability protection for the owners performing work in the\ncanal.\nThe EPA believes that there are a moderate number of locations where bulkheads are\nso deteriorated that they may fail when the temporary sheet-piling is removed after\ndredging. In such cases, the EPA intends to cooperate with NYC on inspection and\nenforcement of existing NYC bulkhead maintenance requirements. To reduce costs for\naffected bulkhead owners, the EPA will assist with coordinating the permitting approval,\ndesign and construction.\nWhile the EPA will continue working with all of the stakeholders, it recognizes that it is\nnot possible to insure that all of the bulkheads that need to be replaced will be replaced.\nTherefore, some substandard bulkheads may still remain. If the continued presence of\nsuch substandard bulkheads is judged to present a threat to the integrity of the canal\nremedy, available CERCLA authorities and/or resources would be used, as necessary,\nto ensure their repair.\nAt the present time, a number of property owners along the canal have initiated\nreplacement of their bulkheads and are coordinating their designs with the layout of the\npreferred remedy.\nSheet Piling for Bulkhead Upgrades and Restoration\nComment #261: NYCDEP asserts that costs for sheet piling for bulkhead upgrading and\nrestoration are based upon sheet piling lengths that are too short and, therefore, the\ncosts are too low. Impacts due to presence of debris, outfalls, bridge abutments, and\nutilities have not been considered. Compliance with historical and archaeological study\nrecommendations have not been considered.\nResponse #261: As stated in Table F-1 of Appendix F in the FS report, p. 3 of 11, sheet\npiles in RTAs 1 and 2 would be 35 feet long, and sheet piles in RTA 3 would be 50 feet\nlong.\nUsing an estimated ground surface elevation in RTA 1 of +6, and a dredge elevation of -\n18 feet, 35 foot sheets would leave an average embedment of 11 feet in the underlying\nnative sediment. These replacement walls assume installation of tieback anchors,\nwhich reduces the length of embedment required. Also, 3. 5 feet of cap will be placed\nover the dredged surface which will enhance the long term stability, giving a long-term\nembedment of 14.5 feet on average. During the design, 40-foot long sheets may prove\nto be more appropriate in RTA 1, and 45-foot long sheets in RTA 2 where the dredge\nelevation is -22 feet. Fifty foot-long sheets would be appropriate in the first segment in\nV-167\nRTA 3, where the dredge depth is 28.5 feet, but perhaps 70 foot sheets may be needed\nin the second segment of RTA 3 where the dredge depth is 41.5 feet. As expected, re-\nrunning the costs with this set of assumptions does change the base implementation\ncapital costs (as shown in Table F-2a of Appendix F in the FS) – in this case from $93\nmillion to $112 million. The final depth of sheet piles will be determined during the\ndesign.\nThe comments on the cost estimate do not acknowledge the conservative assumption\nmade in the FS that 80% of all of the existing bulkheads would need complete\nreplacement with new sheet piling. As stated in responses to previous comments , a\nthorough analysis to determine what percentage of the existing bulkheads would need\ncomplete replacement, what percentage require improvement with remedial measures\n(such as replacement of wales and tieback anchors in existing sheet piling), and what\npercentage are satisfactory as is, is customarily done during the remedial design and\nnot during the FS. NYCDEP points to a 2000 report that states 40% of the existing\nbulkheads are in fair or worse condition. It can be assumed that at least this\npercentage, and maybe a little more by now, require complete replacement. One\nreasonable scenario would be that 50% of the bulkheads require complete replacement,\n30% would require remedial measures equal to one-half the cost of complete\nreplacement, and 20% require no remedial measures at all. Using these assumptions,\nand the revised sheet pile lengths outlined above, the total cost would be $94 million,\nessentially the same as the original FS estimate.\nAs noted previously, the EPA anticipates that a significant fraction of the canal\nbulkheads will be upgraded for non-project related work, including by National Grid for\ncontainment walls at the three former MGP facilities, and by property owners and\ndevelopers.\nSheet Piling for Temporary Cells\nComment #262: NYCDEP asserts that costs for the installation and removal of sheet\npiling for the temporary cells are not consistent with sheet piling installation costs for\nupgrading of the permanent bulkheads.\nResponse #262: There is a significant difference between the sheet piling installed as\npart of the temporary remedial cells and sheet piling installed as a permanent\nreplacement bulkhead wall. As stated in Table F-1 of Appendix F in the FS report, p. 4\nof 11, sheet piling for the remedial cells would be used to contain turbidity and NAPL\nrelease during remedial activities, but would not be designed to withstand differential\nhead pressures created by lowering water within the cell (except for up to five feet\ndifferential due to tidal fluctuation). Sheet pile wall joints would not need to be\ncompletely watertight because no significant pressure differential would exist. A less\nrobust section of sheet pile is assumed for the cells versus the bulkhead replacement\nsheet piling due to the significantly lower bending moments acting upon those sheets.\nThe extraction and reinstallation cost for the remedial cell sheet piling is lower still since\nthere is no new material cost associated with this work.\nV-168\nSediment Dredging Production Rate\nComment #263: NYCDEP asserts that the assumed sediment dredging production rate\nis too high. It should be less than half of the assumed rate. Dredging should be\nassumed be on a five 12-hour day schedule instead of a seven 12-hour day weekly\nschedule. The increase in dredging time will add a minimum $10 million to $15 million\nto the project costs.\nResponse #263: The estimated costs were based on a specific assumption regarding\nthe dredging schedule. If this assumption is changed and the work schedule is 5 days,\nthe estimated costs would increase by an estimated $15 million for Alternative 5 and an\nestimated $16 million for Alternative 7. The work schedule will be determined during the\ndesign. Work hours may vary depending on Site-specific factors. For example, the\nwork day could be longer in RTA 3 as it is an industrial area without the likely noise\nimpacts as compared to RTA 1.\nCurrent and Future Conditions\nComment #264: National Grid commented on the need to understand navigational uses,\nstrike the proper balance between commercial traffic and restoration of ecological\nconditions, maintain dissolved oxygen conditions meeting surface water standards for\nthe canal and understand how the canal will perform under canal future uses and\nconditions. Also, National Grid suggested that the implementation of the remedy should\nnot preclude the wide variety of industrial, commercial and residential activities currently\nongoing in the canal’s vicinity.\nResponse #264: The EPA recognizes that there is a balance of optimum conditions\nbetween several factors, such as future commercial and community navigational uses of\nthe canal, canal depth, Flushing Tunnel flows, dissolved oxygen concentrations and\nbenthic habitat that the remedial design must address, while ensuring that the CERCLA\nRAOs are being met. The remedial design will address the balance between these\nconditions in a manner that meets the CERCLA objectives.\nThe Proposed Plan and ROD do not preclude current or future uses of the canal or any\nindividual type of development in the canal’s vicinity. The only requirement will be that\nany such development cannot contribute contaminant loads to the canal that would\nreduce the protectiveness of the remedy. Stormwater from future development will\nneed to be treated prior to discharge in the canal and sewer use regulated so as to not\nbe inconsistent with the contaminated CSO solids controls required in the ROD.\nFuture Use of Canal\nComment #265: National Grid notes that given that the canal has had limited use (as\nrevealed by the present state of sediment accumulation) and given the plans for\nresidential/recreational development along the canal, it is unlikely that there will be a\nneed for deeper navigation depths. At the very least, it appears that the upper portion\nof the canal will eventually be limited to recreational traffic, which reduces any\nV-169\nrequirement for depth and thus reduces the need for dredging. NYCDEP asserts that\nthe EPA is proposing to expand the existing navigational channel into the middle and\nupper reaches of the canal.\nResponse #265: The EPA has reviewed a information relating to the current and\nanticipated future use of the canal and the Gowanus area. This includes, but is not\nlimited to, documents on the NYCDEP’s WWFP (Section 2), NYCDEP’s preliminary\nGowanus area re-zoning (presently on hold), the Gowanus Community Development\nCorp. Comprehensive Community Plan (2006), the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway Plan\n(2005), the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) draft Navigation White Paper\n(2007) and the New York City 2020 Waterfront Vision Report and Community Board Six\ncomments.\nThe EPA has had ongoing interactions with developers, including the Whole Foods\nstore project, the Lightstone Group and Gowanus Green residential projects, as well as\nan array of current business owners, prospective developers and purchasers. The EPA\nis also participating in Community Board Six’s Brownfields Opportunity Area (BOA)\nGrant process, which has reviewed a range of area zoning issues and needs with the\ngoal of promoting redevelopment.\nNYCDEP, in its Proposed Plan comments, made observations regarding the mixed use\nof the canal and surrounding areas and the need to coordinate with the community\nregarding a range of short- and longer-term project impacts, noting:\nWhile the zoning along the Canal itself consists mostly of manufacturing districts,\nallowing a variety of commercial and industrial uses, there is also zoning that\npermits residential development. Additionally, longstanding residential districts\nare mapped in very close proximity to the Canal. Scattered throughout the\nmanufacturing zoning districts are also long existing, non-conforming residential\nuses. Based on the historical development of the neighborhood, there are no\nclear functional boundaries between industrial and residential areas. (NYCDEP\nProposed Plan comment #11.7, page 80.)\nThe EPA generally agrees with this land use characterization. Based on the current\nand pending projects noted above and continued prospective residential development\nactivity, increasing dining and entertainment businesses around the canal, and formal\nrequests to NYC to restart the re-zoning process, (e.g., a Community Board Six October\n12, 2012 resolution regarding the Lightstone Group), the EPA believes that there will\nlikely be an increased intensity in land use around the canal over a broad range of\nsectors.\nCommercial navigation is currently limited to the lower and middle canal. Limited draft\nin the canal presently hinders such navigation. The limited draft, together with vessel\ntraffic and barge mooring, affect sediment accumulation and re-suspension patterns and\nimpacts. The EPA has also received requests from business owners engaged in\ncommercial navigation regarding potential bulkhead upgrades for their operations. The\nEPA anticipates that such commercial navigation will continue and may possibly\nincrease following implementation of the selected remedy, which would reduce\nnavigational impediments.\nV-170\nIn the upper canal, navigation is limited to recreational use, infrastructure upgrade and\nrepair, and remedial-related work. Future navigation will need to be maintained for\ninfrastructure and redevelopment work as well as post-construction remedial\nmaintenance. Future residential development may also potentially create a demand for\nother water-related navigation, such as water taxis, which have been depicted in upper\ncanal residential redevelopment renderings.\nOverall, the increased population living on and around the canal, together with the\ncorresponding increase in recreational use of the canal, would tend to increase the\npotential for exposure in the absence of a comprehensive cleanup.\nProperty Values\nComment #266: A commenter expressed concern that once the canal is remediated,\nproperty values and rents in the area between Carroll Gardens and Park Slope, where\nthe residential properties have been undervalued because of flooding, will increase\nsignificantly, potentially displacing those that cannot afford a substantial rent increase.\nAnother commenter expressed a similar concern about the Red Hook area.\nResponse #266: Under CERCLA, the EPA must select a remedy which is protective of\nhuman health and the environment. Such a remedy must take into account reasonably\nanticipated future land use so that the cleanup is appropriate for that land use. Future\nproperty valuation, however, is not among the selection criteria.\nProperty values in Brooklyn generally have been rising, and in Gowanus in particular,\neven in advance of any clean up. It is likely that property values in the area will\ncontinue to rise as investment and redevelopment (e.g., the Whole Foods project)\nadvances. While the EPA acknowledges the comment, other agencies have jurisdiction\nfor such issues. It is suggested that concerns about rents and property values be\ndirected to elected officials.\nLong-Term Monitoring\nComment #267: A commenter seeks confirmation that long-term monitoring will be\nperformed to ensure that the implemented remedy works.\nResponse #267: Long-term monitoring would be performed to insure that the\nimplemented remedy continues to function effectively. A long-term monitoring plan will\nbe developed by the PRPs as part of the remedy, with oversight and input from the\nEPA, NYSDEC and other participating agencies. Such documents will be provided to\nthe public for informal input as part of the ongoing community involvement process.\nV-171\nSediment Toxicity Reduction\nComment #268: A commenter asked why the goal for sediment toxicity reduction is\nbased on the Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference area.\nResponse #268: As a general rule, Superfund does not clean up hazardous waste sites\nbeyond background conditions. The judgment of Superfund is that it does not make\nsense to have a completely clean area surrounded by contaminated areas. In this\ninstance, the background areas were determined to be sufficiently protective of the\necosystem for the purposes of the canal cleanup.\nRestoration of Fishing in Canal\nComment #269: A commenter asked whether it is likely that fishing will ever be allowed\nin the canal.\nResponse #269: Fishing advisories promulgated by the New York State Department of\nHealth (NYSDOH) currently apply to the New York/New Jersey Harbor area, including\ntributaries, such as the canal. These advisories vary based on species and the age and\ngender of the consumer (see http://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2784.pdf). In\ngeneral, fish consumption is not advised for children and women of childbearing age.\nNYCDEP signs are posted along the canal at CSO outfalls indicating that fishing is\nprohibited.\nThe EPA has also produced a Gowanus-related fact sheet regarding fish consumption (\nsee http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/gowanus/pdf/gowanus_colorcoding-\n041212.pdf).\nDespite the fish advisory, posted warnings and public outreach efforts, the canal and\nharbor areas near the canal are regularly used for fishing, particularly subsistence\nfishing by surrounding EJ communities.\nAlthough implementation of the canal remedy should slightly reduce contaminant\nloadings to the New York/New Jersey Harbor, it is unlikely that fishing advisories will be\nlifted in the foreseeable future. While the EPA believes that ecological conditions in the\ncanal should improve following implementation of the remedy such that water and\nsediment conditions will more closely resemble those of the harbor, post-remediation\nmonitoring will be necessary to determine whether fishing, other than catch-and-\nrelease, is advisable within the canal.\nIn addition, NYSDOH looked at the data that was collected as part of the RI and\nconcluded that exposure to the high levels of bacteria that are present in the canal due\nto the sewer outflows pose an acute (short-term) public health threat. Although\npathogen exposure was not considered for CERCLA remedy selection purposes, the\ncontaminated CSO solids controls which are part of the selected remedy will also\nreduce human health risks associated with pathogens.\nV-172\nPublic Health Assessment\nComment #270: A commenter expressed concern that the Agency for Toxic Substances\nand Disease Registry’s (ATSDR’s) public health assessment was not presented in the\nhuman health risk section of the proposed plan.\nResponse #270: A HHRA is an analysis of the potential adverse health effects caused\nby hazardous substance releases from a site in the absence of any actions to control or\nmitigate the hazardous substances under current- and future-land uses. It is the basis\nfor determining whether or not a remedial action is necessary at a site.\nATSDR, through a cooperative agreement with NYSDOH, prepares public health\nassessments for facilities independent of the EPA remedy selection process (i.e., public\nhealth assessments are not included in the human health risk section of proposed\nplans). During the preparation of the public health assessments, NYSDOH and ATSDR\nreview the environmental information available for the Site and prepare conclusions and\nrecommendations for public health actions.\nATSDR and NYSDOH expect to release the public health assessment for the Site in\nlate 2013.\nHuman Health Risk Assessment\nComment #271: Several commenters asked that the threat to public health be identified.\nResponse #271: An HHRA for the Gowanus Canal was performed as part of the RI.\nThe HHRA evaluated potential current and future risks to recreational users, anglers,\nresidents and industrial workers in and near the canal. The HHRA evaluated the\npotential human risks from exposure to surface water, sediment, ambient air and\ningestion of fish and shellfish, concluding that unacceptable long-term (more than 30\nyears) exposure risk levels are posed by surface water/sediment contact and fish/crab\nconsumption..\nIn addition, NYSDOH looked at the data that was collected as part of the RI and\nconcluded that exposure to the high levels of bacteria that are present in the canal due\nto the sewer outflows pose an acute (short-term) public health threat.\nHuman Health Risk Assessment Assumptions\nComment #272: ConEd asserts that the HHRA relies on exposure assumptions that are\noverly conservative and do not represent a reasonable maximum exposure (RME) as\ndefined by the EPA and that the human health risk estimates were described in the RI\nas “likely overestimates,” but were not refined.\nV-173\nResponse #272: At the time that the HHRA was initiated, no specific information was\navailable for fishing/crabbing and ingesting fish or crab caught from the Gowanus\nCanal. Observations by the EPA and anecdotal information suggested that regular fish\nconsumption was occurring both within the canal and near the mouth of the canal. This\nis supported by studies which show that many people in the area ignore fish advisories\nthat are placed on local waterways. Therefore, fish ingestion rates from local studies for\nthe Newark Bay Complex (Burger, 2002) were used in the HHRA. These fish ingestion\nrates are similar to the ingestion rates used in HHRAs prepared for other local water\nbodies.\nThe risk estimates for fish and crab ingestion were supplemented in the FS report\naddendum by evaluating a subsistence fishing scenario. The subsistence fishing\ningestion rate was based on information obtained from a 2010 Fish Consumption\nEducation Project in Brooklyn (Going Coastal Inc., 2010). The purpose of the project\nwas to identify who is fishing and what is being caught and eaten along the shores of\nBrooklyn in order to reduce the consumption of contaminated fish and lessen potential\nhealth problems among the local subsistence and recreational fishing population. Of\nthe respondents, 57 percent said they were trying to catch striped bass and more than\nhalf responded that they were trying to catch bluefish. The survey showed that most of\nthe fish caught were consumed. Almost all of the fish are eaten either by the anglers\nthemselves (62 percent), shared with their family and friends, and/or given to other\nanglers. More than a quarter of the respondents explicitly said that children under the\nage of 15 eat the fish they catch. The fish ingestion rate for the subsistence fishermen\nrisk calculations was based on the median consumption value of eight fish meals per\nmonth for those who feed their catch to children. Given the evidence of both\nrecreational and subsistence fishing in and near the canal, a RAO was developed to\naddress the potential risks associated with fish and shellfish ingestion.\nAdditionally, the sediment remedy for the canal is expected to create conditions that will\nencourage greater recreational use (including fishing and ingestion of fish). Therefore,\nthe use of the recreational and subsistence exposure assumptions is appropriate for\ndetermining the actions that need to be taken to reduce potential future unacceptable\nrisks.\nComment #273: ConEd asserts that unrealistic assumptions about the relative\npercentages of species consumed by anglers were used.\nResponse #273: The EPA believes that the technical basis for establishing the mix of\nspecies consumed by anglers is reasonable, but recognizes that other reasonable\nassumptions also could be used. It should be noted that revising the percentages as\nsuggested in the comments would not change the results of the risk calculations.\nContribution of Gowanus Canal to PCB Levels in Fish\nComment #274: ConEd asserted that the EPA provided no data or analyses to support\nthe assumption that PCBs in Gowanus Canal sediments contribute to the PCB levels in\nfish tissue .\nV-174\nResponse #274: Because the species targeted in the HHRA (striped bass, white perch,\nAmerican eel and blue crab) inhabit areas that are larger than the canal, the PCB\nconcentrations in their tissue reflect cumulative uptake from all of the areas in which\nthey forage. Therefore, the PCB concentrations in fish and shellfish caught in the canal\ncannot be directly linked to PCB concentrations in the canal sediments alone. However,\nthis does not mean that fish and crab do not accumulate PCBs from Gowanus Canal\nsediments; it simply means that it is not technically feasible to determine the relative\ncontributions of PCBs from the canal (and other areas) to the overall tissue burden of\nPCBs in the fish. The EPA acknowledges the uncertainty in directly linking tissue\nconcentrations of PCBs to sediment concentrations; however, both sediment and fish\nand crab tissue PCB concentrations appear to be elevated in the canal samples relative\nto the reference area samples, suggesting a contribution from canal sediments.\nTo address this uncertainty, the RAO for the consumption of fish and shellfish was\ndeveloped to specifically target PCB concentrations in sediments rather than fish tissue:\nReduce the contribution of PCBs from the canal to fish and shellfish by reducing\nPCB concentrations in surface sediment to levels that are within the range of\nGowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay reference concentrations.\nThe EPA believes that this RAO accurately describes what the cleanup is expected to\naccomplish, and is considered to be achievable.\nThe EPA’s sampling has established the presence of PCBs in fish in both Upper New\nYork Bay and the canal. These results are consistent with broader studies and the New\nYork State fish advisories which ConEd advocates reliance on. The EPA’s position\nregarding the contribution to fish tissue from PCBs in canal sediments is consistent with\nthe EPA’s experience at other sediment sites. See, for example, the EPA’s Hudson\nRiver PCBs Record of Decision and Responsiveness Summary, February 2002.\nConversely, ConEd’s comments do not provide any technical support for the suggestion\nthat PCB uptake would occur only while fish are in Upper New York Bay, then either not\noccur or discontinue while exposed to PCBs within the canal.\nPCB Toxicity to Benthic Organisms\nComment #275: ConEd asserts that the EPA has not demonstrated that PCBs are toxic\nto benthic organisms.\nResponse #275: In the baseline ecological risk assessment (BERA), contaminants were\nidentified as potential contributors to toxicity if concentrations exceeded risk-based\nscreening levels and were significantly higher than reference area concentrations. The\nEPA acknowledges that there are multiple approaches for assessing whether a\ncontaminant may contribute to sediment toxicity. Each of these approaches has its own\nstrengths and uncertainties in terms of correctly predicting sediment toxicity. In the\ncase of Gowanus Canal sediment, the EPA believes that the approach used in the\nBERA is sufficient to show that PCBs have the potential to contribute to the observed\ntoxicity. However, because PAHs are the primary cause of sediment toxicity and the\ndriver of ecological risk at this Site, the EPA does not believe that it is necessary to use\nmore sophisticated approaches to develop PCB toxicity thresholds. Because the\nV-175\nselected remedy will also remove PCBs that co-occur with the PAHs targeted for\nremediation, the level of evaluation of PCBs conducted in the BERA was determined to\nbe adequate to support a risk management decision.\nThe RAO for the protection of the benthic community focuses on the reduction of\ntoxicity, regardless of the source. As stated, the EPA believes risks to the benthic\ncommunity to be primarily associated with PAHs but there are potential contributions\nfrom PCBs and metals that cannot be ruled out.\nEcological Threats\nComment #276: A commenter expressed concern that the contamination in the canal\ncould adversely affect the fish that live in the canal.\nResponse #276: The contamination in the canal has already impacted fish that live in\nthe canal. The average concentration of PCBs in canal fish samples collected by the\nEPA is about two times higher than the average PCB concentrations in the reference\narea samples collected from Gowanus Bay and Upper New York Bay. Because PAHs\nnormally metabolize quickly, fish tissue samples were not analyzed for PAHs. As noted\nabove, NYSDOH has issued a fish advisory covering the entire Gowanus Canal.\nDuring the remedial design, appropriate controls will be selected to limit contaminant re-\nsuspension and transport during dredging. The EPA will also consider whether\nadditional measures will be necessary to restrict fishing during dredging.\nAir Emissions\nComment #277: A commenter expressed concern about the potential wind transport of\ncontaminants from surface sediment exposed during low tides in the upper reach of the\ncanal.\nResponse #277: It is unlikely that the wind will mobilize a significant amount of\ncontamination from surface sediment exposed during low tides in the upper reach of the\ncanal due its grain size and moisture content. During the RI, air samples were collected\nfrom street-level locations along the length of the canal and from three background\nlocations (two blocks west of the canal). The results from this sampling indicate that the\ntypes and concentrations of contaminants detected in air samples were similar,\nregardless of the sample location. The constituents detected were typical of those\nfound in urban environments.\nComment #278: A commenter expressed concern about atmospheric releases during\ndewatering. Other commenters expressed concern about releases into the atmosphere\nduring the dredging and processing. Two commenters urged the EPA to collect real-\ntime air data and make that data available to the public. Two commenters noted that\nthe ongoing Onondaga Lake site dredging has resulted in odor complaints. The\nV-176\ncommenter expressed concern that the processing of the Gowanus Canal sediments\nwould also create an odor problem. Two commenters asked whether the dredging and\nprocessing would pose risks to the community through air emissions. Another\ncommenter asked whether it will be safe for the 700+ residents that will occupy the\nrental building that the Lightstone Group wants to erect along the canal since the canal\ncleanup will not be completed for at least 10 years. Another commenter expressed\nconcern that allowing the area to be developed prior to remediation, thereby placing\ngreed before public health, would be akin to the tragedy of Love Canal--citing\nCommissioner of the State Health Department Dr. David Axelrod's 1998 statement that\nLove Canal will likely long endure as a ''national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense\nof concern for future generations. ''\nResponse #278: The intent of implementing remedies at Superfund facilities is to\nprotect public health and the environment. The implementation of the remedies\nthemselves must be implemented in a manner which is also protective of public health.\nThe sediments in the canal are contaminated with a number of volatile organic\ncompounds that could be released when brought to the surface. Odors described as\n\"organic,\" \"septic-like,\" \"sulfur-like\" and \"hydrocarbon-like\" are commonly detected\nduring low tide. To prevent the exposure of the remediation workers and the\nsurrounding community to volatile organic emissions and to prevent noxious odors,\nmeasures to control the air emissions and odors during the dredging and processing of\nthe sediments will be developed during the design of the remedy. In addition, air\nmonitoring equipment will be placed at various locations in the vicinity of the areas\nwhere dredging is conducted and in the processing areas to determine if the air\nemission and odor controls are effective or if modifications and corrective actions are\nnecessary. The monitoring data will be made available to the public.\nWhile there were odor complaints at the Onondaga Lake site once the dredging and\nprocessing of lake bottom sediments commenced last year, the contractors have\nimplemented a number of odor-control measures which appear to have significantly\nreduced the odor complaints.\nThe EPA will continue its proactive public outreach and interaction efforts during the\nremedial design and subsequent dredging in order to properly address such concerns.\nComment #279: Two commenters expressed concern about the potential adverse\nhealth effects attributable to air releases associated with the remediation efforts in the\ncanal, noting air release concerns related to the dredging effort at the Onondaga Lake\nsite expressed by residents in the Town of Camillus, New York. One of the commenters\nstated that a consultant hired by the Town of Camillus and some of its residents\nindicated in a report that air toxic concentrations are pervasive throughout the\ncommunity and that short- and long-term safe levels are being exceeded, contrary to\nthe stated findings of a supplemental HHRA produced by the EPA for the Onondaga\nLake project, which indicated that residential risks associated with the management of\ncontaminated sediment would not result in Exceedances of acceptable risks to the\nnearby communities. The commenter also alleged that the Supplemental HHRA was\nV-177\nconducted because an air pathway analysis (APA) for the project was never performed,\neven though detailed project planning documents specified that an APA be conducted,\nand that an APA is required under Superfund.\nResponse #279: The EPA acknowledges the comments with respect to the Onondaga\nLake site remediation. The EPA believes that the public’s questions and concerns\nrelated to air monitoring are being addressed with respect to that project. Although\nthere is no CERCLA requirement that one be performed, an APA to assess the extent of\npotential emissions from technologies being considered and evaluated for the\nOnondaga Lake site was conducted during the FS phase of the project.\nGiven the odors currently associated with the Gowanus Canal even in the absence of\nremedial work, the EPA acknowledges the need for adequate odor controls and air\nmonitoring during dredging and any sediment handling. During the remedial design, the\nEPA will work with the community in the development of a community health and safety\nplan as part of our continued public outreach and interaction efforts in order to properly\naddress such concerns.\nComment #280: A commenter opined that it is not clear what impact the dewatering of\ncontaminated material will have on the air quality, since an APA was not performed in\nconnection with such a facility. The commenter asserts that the failure to perform the\nAPA is not in accordance with the law. If an APA had been performed, opined the\ncommenter, it would clearly show unacceptable risks to nearby residents owing to very\nhigh predicted levels of airborne exposure.\nResponse #280: Although an APA was not performed during the RI/FS, the short- and\nlong-term impacts of the dredging and capping alternatives were evaluated as part of\nthe FS. An APA will be performed during remedial design, once the material handling\nspecifications and rates have been determined. The results of the APA will then be\nused to identify the design requirements for perimeter air monitoring systems for the\nSite, including the removal and treatment areas, as well as other controls to limit\nreleases to air.\nAir monitoring will be conducted and mitigation measures will be implemented during\nthe remedial activities to control the release of hazardous compounds. Dredging best\nmanagement practices will be used to minimize the disturbance of sediments during the\ndredging process, thereby limiting releases to the air. The potential for airborne\ndistribution (e.g., dust generation) will be limited by the high moisture content of the\nsediment, even after any dewatering procedures. Odor controls will be implemented to\nthe degree practicable.\nAs noted above, an APA will be performed before the remedy is implemented. The\nEPA has, therefore, correctly identified the regulatory standards for this pathway that\nwill require compliance during project construction, and, therefore, the selected remedy\nis in accordance with the law. After conducting the APA, the appropriate air monitoring,\nmitigation and other health and safety measures will be utilized during construction.\nDuring both the remedial design process and dredging, the EPA will continue to interact\nwith the public regarding the APA and other project impact concerns.\nV-178\nNational Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan\nComment #281: NYCDEP asserts that the EPA has not followed the NCP by relying on\nthe NYSDEC to be the lead agency for the former MGP facility cleanup remedies, other\nupland parcels referred to the NYSDEC for evaluation by the EPA and unpermitted pipe\noutfalls, rather than directly evaluating (e.g., alternatives, cost, Applicable or Relevant\nand Appropriate Requirements, etc.) and selecting these former MGP facility and\nupland cleanups as part of the remedy selection process for the Gowanus Canal.\nNYCDEP also asserts that the EPA is delegating remedy selection to the State, contrary\nto the NCP requirements.\nResponse #281: The EPA has, by agreement with the NYSDEC, divided the lead\nresponsibilities for various aspects of the Site. NYSDEC has the primary lead on\nuplands cleanups under its State Superfund and Brownfields programs. The State,\nwhich had long-term experience and familiarity with the former MGP facility cleanups\nprior to the NPL proposal of the Site, retained this responsibility. NYSDEC oversees\nalmost all of the former MGP facility cleanups within the State, and has extensive\nexperience with its former MGP program.\nSuch a division of agency roles, particularly for upland cleanups at sediment sites, is not\nan unusual approach. At the Hudson River PCBs Superfund site, for example,\nNYSDEC is the lead agency for the upland plant site cleanups while the EPA is the lead\nfor the river portion of the site.\nThe EPA has reviewed the data, technical reports and remedial documents generated\nto date with respect to the former MGP facilities and incorporated these documents into\nthe administrative record. The EPA has provided, as a contingency measure in the\nProposed Plan and ROD, “In the unlikely event that a timely and effective State-\nselected remedy is not implemented at a given former MGP facility, the EPA may\nimplement actions pursuant to CERCLA to ensure the protectiveness of the preferred\nremedy.” In a similar manner, NYSDEC has the lead on CWA compliance under state\nlaw, with the EPA having the ability to take separate enforcement action under federal\nauthority ,if necessary.\nWith respect to the additional upland parcels which were referred to NYSDEC, the EPA\ngenerated the information regarding these sites during the RI. The EPA has determined\nthat while these additional parcels require investigation and potential remediation, they\nlikely contribute a smaller potential contaminant load as compared with the other\nsources to the canal. The investigation and potential cleanup of these parcels is of a\nlower priority than the sediments, former MGP facilities and the CSOs. As with the\nformer MGP facilities, the EPA retains the authority to implement additional actions\nunder CERCLA, if necessary.\nBecause the EPA is not directly selecting the remedy for these upland sites, the\ncomplete evaluation process for these are not addressed in the FS and other\ndocuments for this remedy. The selected remedy, which is intended to be a\ncomprehensive overall approach for the canal, addresses the method through which\nV-179\neach source is handled. Additional decision documents may be necessary to select the\nremedy for a given parcel.\nWith respect to the handful of unpermitted pipe outfalls which may be active and need\nto be addressed, the WWFP determined:\nOverall, the total contribution of flow from these additional point sources was\ndetermined to be insignificant relative to CSO and stormwater inputs. The 154\nMGD average induced flow resulting from the Flushing Tunnel, as described\nelsewhere in this report, further diminishes the significance of these inputs.\nNYCDEP WWFP (2008), page 4-39\nThe Proposed Plan and ROD state that the EPA will work in coordination with NYCDEP\nand NYSDEC to either permit or permanently seal these pipes. The cost of sealing a\nlimited number of pipes is nominal. The cost of permitting would be borne by the pipe\nowners, not the PRPs, and is, therefore, outside of the selected remedy cost.\nComment #282: ConEd asserts that the EPA has not complied with the requirements of\nthe NCP with respect to human health and ecological risk from exposure to PCBs that\nthe EPA did not develop sufficient information regarding PCBs with respect to the Site,\nand that the PRGs and RAOs were not developed following the NCP requirements,\nprimarily because impacts of PCBs to fish are regional as well as local to the canal.\nResponse #282: The EPA believes that the information developed with respect to the\npresence of and effects of PCB and its application through the PRGs and RAOs is not\ninconsistent with the NCP. Although a broader regional problem will remain for PCB\nexposure through fish consumption, the selected remedy indicates that the risk from this\nexposure pathway will be reduced. By nature, a regional problem can often only be\naddressed in a step-wise fashion, of which the selected remedy is one part. The\ndocuments in the administrative record adequately demonstrate both the exposure risk\nand the risk reduction which is anticipated. Finally, because the PCBs are co-located\nwith other COCs within the canal sediments, it is not possible to avoid addressing the\nPCBs.\nSediment Bioremediation\nComment #283: Two commenters expressed concern that bioremediation is not being\nconsidered as a strategy to address the contaminated sediments. One of the\ncommenters noted that plants have been utilized to detoxify waterways and soil. The\nother commenter cited an ecological designer's work in restoring a polluted canal in\nChina to its natural beauty (http://toddecological.com/PDFs/100623.casestudy.baima.\npdf) and suggested that bioremediation would be a less expensive and safer option with\na better long term investment for the community.\nV-180\nResponse #283: The cited ecological designer’s effort was related to sewage\ndischarges to surface water. This could be a potential option to address the CSOs.\nBioremediation was considered in the FS as a potential technology for the cleanup of\nthe canal. While bioremediation can successfully destroy organic contaminants in\nsediment, since there are so many different organic contaminants at such high\nconcentrations present in the sediments and since the contaminants are very deep,\nbioremediation cannot be practically applied to this Site. Therefore, it was screened\nout.\nComment #284: A commenter cited phytoremediation and mycoremediation (using\nplants and fungi to degrade or sequester contaminants, respectively) studies conducted\nby the EPA’s Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation Program and suggested that\nthey might be applicable to the Site. The commenter noted that fungi have been shown\nto break down the same PCBs and PAHs found in the Gowanus Canal sediments and\nthey also have the ability to accumulate heavy metals which can then be extracted.\nHeavy metals, once extracted with mushrooms or other bioaccumulators do not pose\nthe risk of leaching. The commenter also noted that mycoremediation is significantly\nless environmentally taxing than heat-treating the sediment to rid it of PCBs and PAHs.\nThe commenter also suggested the EPA conduct treatability studies on a small portion\nof the dredged sediment as a means to not only inform future Superfund cleanups, but\nserve to promote ecologically and economically effective practices.\nResponse #284: While phytoremediation and mycoremediation might be appropriate\ntechnologies to address some of the contaminants found at the Site under certain\nconditions, the physical state (volume and texture) and the chemical complexity\n(hundreds of organic chemicals and metals that are chemically bound in ways that\nmake them unavailable to plant or biological uptake) of the contaminated sediments in\nthe canal do not render these technologies suitable for either in-situ or ex-situ treatment\nof the sediments.\nComment #285: A commenter asked whether the data suggests that the contaminants\nin the canal have been increasing or decreasing as a result of microbial action.\nResponse #285: While some microbial degradation of the contaminants in the\nsediments is likely to be occurring, since the level of contamination in the canal\nsediments is so significant and since CSOs and upland sources continue to contribute\ncontamination to the canal, there is no practical way to measure such degradation. The\ncontinued presence of high levels of hazardous substances which were disposed of\nfrom decades to a century ago suggest that microbial action is not having a significant\neffect.\nCanal Dewatering\nComment #286: A commenter urged the EPA to dewater the canal, treat the water and\nthen use natural processes to treat the contaminated sediments instead of dredging.\nV-181\nResponse #286: While the temporary draining of all or portions of the canal to facilitate\nimplementation of the remedy was considered, it was ruled out for the entire canal\nbecause removal of canal water could induce canal wall and bottom instabilities due to\nincreased exerted pressures. Draining of the canal for remedy implementation would\nlimit remedial and commercial barge access and conflict with the current configuration\nfor CSO and stormwater discharges and odor control for such a large area of dewatered\nsediments would be difficult. In addition, groundwater influx, which varies throughout\nthe canal, would require significant on-going pumping capacity.\nWhile natural processes, such as bioremediation, can successfully destroy some of the\norganic contaminants in the sediment, since there are so many different organic\ncontaminants at such high concentrations present in the sediments and since the\ncontaminants are very deep, bioremediation cannot be practically applied to this Site.\nContractual\nComment #287: Two commenters asked who will operate the dewatering facility.\nAnother commenter asked whether a local contractor that has pollution violations would\nbe barred from bidding on the remediation work contracts.\nResponse #287: The EPA anticipates that some local workers and subcontractors may\nbe hired by the prime contractor to provide secondary support services and materials,\nbut Superfund cleanup work is typically conducted by experienced, specialized\nremediation companies that adhere to the EPA’s high standards. The work will be\nperformed by contractors bidding to construct the EPA-approved engineering designs.\nThe contractors will be subject to EPA review, approval and oversight.\nRemediation Schedule\nComment #288: A commenter stated that increasing large-scale development along the\nbanks of the canal in combination with predicted average annual rainfall increases and\nrising sea levels contribute to the urgency to address the CSOs and contaminated\nsediments in a timely manner. Several commenters stated that they want the EPA to\nmove forward as quickly as possible with the remedy selection, design and construction\nprocess. Another commenter asked when the remediation of the canal would be\ncompleted. A third commenter stated that those parties that are responsible for the\ncontamination should pay for the implementation of the remedy.\nResponse #288: Following the selection of a remedy for the Site, it is the EPA’s\nintention to use its enforcement authorities to compel the PRPs to undertake the\nperformance of the design and construction of the remedy at their own expense. It is\nanticipated that the negotiations related to the performance of the design and\nconstruction of the selected remedy will take several months to complete. The design\nwill take an estimated three years to perform. It is anticipated that the remediation, will\nV-182\ncommence with the upper reach and progress downstream. Each of the three areas will\ntake approximately two years to complete. Therefore, it is anticipated that the design\nwill be completed in 2016 and the remediation by 2022.\nSurface Water Classification\nComment #289: A commenter indicated that the community strongly supports a higher\nlevel of reclassification of the canal (swimmable) and habitat restoration at all levels\n(benthic, aquatic and available canal bank areas).\nResponse #289: The canal upstream of the Gowanus Expressway has been designated\n“Use Class SD,” which is suitable for fish survival. The area downstream of the\nGowanus Expressway is designated “Use Class I,” which is suitable for finfish\npropagation and survival. Currently, background surface water contaminant\nconcentrations are not suitable for swimming and habitat restoration at all levels. The\ndegree to which the Gowanus Canal will be able to achieve a higher classification level\nis unclear. The primary forum to address this issue is under the LTCP and other\nprovisions of the CWA.\nRemedy Reviews\nComment #290: A commenter suggested that, given the likelihood of greater storm\nevents in the future, the implemented remedies, in particular, the CSO abatement\nmeasures and the remedies at the former MGP facilities, should be reviewed more\nfrequently than once every five years, particularly after storm events.\nResponse #290: The purpose of five-year reviews is to ensure that implemented\nremedies protect public health and the environment and that they function as intended\nby the decision documents. To conduct five-year reviews, the EPA reviews site\nmonitoring and maintenance data. At this Site, maintenance of the cap will be\nperformed, as necessary, to insure that it is still protective and periodic long-term\nmonitoring will be performed to insure that the remedy continues to function effectively.\nUnder enforcement agreements, NYCDEP will be responsible for the maintenance and\nmonitoring related to the CSO abatement measures and National Grid will be\nresponsible for the maintenance and monitoring related to the former MGP facilities.\nThe EPA will review all of the monitoring data on a routine basis. It is anticipated that\nmonitoring data following storm events will be closely scrutinized.\nV-183\nWetlands Mitigation\nComment #291: A commenter suggested that the remedial plan needs to detail the\nissues of wetlands mitigation banking31 as it applies to the CDF portion of the remedy,\nsince 10 acres of what is currently legally protected open waters of the United States\nwould be filled in. The commenter also noted that three acres of the Gowanus Canal\nhave been filled in over the past several decades and are legally outstanding violations\nof the CWA.\nResponse #291: The EPA agrees that wetlands mitigation is an important component\nof the remedy. Since a CDF is no longer a component of the remedy, mitigation of the\naffected area is no longer necessary. A secondary benefit derived from the cleanup\nand restoration of the former 1st Street turning basin and the portion of the 4th Street\nturning basin underneath the 3rd Avenue bridge is the mitigation of wetlands impacts\nthat may be associated with the cleanup of the canal from a series of incremental\nintrusions into the canal from cut-off walls and/or bulkhead restoration work. While\nportions of the Gowanus Canal may have been filled in violation of the CWA, other than\nthe turning basins noted above, addressing these filled in areas under the remedy\nwould not consistent with CERCLA.\nLand Development\nComment #292: A commenter suggested that the development of the land contiguous\nto the canal should be thoroughly studied to determine the long-term effects and should\nbe subject to a full environmental impact study. Another commenter expressed concern\nabout the EPA granting special endorsements to projects like Lightstone's 700\napartment building on the canal, which the commenter believes will have a negative\nimpact on the local environment.\nResponse #292: The EPA’s responsibility is related to addressing the contaminated\nsediments. Evaluating environmental impacts associated with developing the land is\noutside the EPA’s authority.\nOne of the objectives of remediating hazardous waste facilities is to restore them to\nproductive use. There are a number of contaminated facilities along the banks of the\ncanal that require remediation. The nature of the post-remediation use of these\nproperties will be determined by local authorities, not the EPA. The EPA has not\nendorsed any particular future use of the properties located on the banks of the canal.\n31 The creation, restoration, or under certain circumstances the increased protection, of an area\nof functioning wetland in advance of, and to offset anticipated wetland impacts within the same\necoregion.\nV-184\nComment #293: A commenter suggested that the EPA mandate that any new housing\nin the area not add to the CSO and that new developments that border the canal should\ntake extensive flood precautions. A commenter suggested that high density residential\nredevelopment may not be the appropriate form of development along the canal banks\ngiven what is known about environmental impacts and potential meteorological\nchanges. Another commenter asked whether the EPA will review whether future high\ndensity residential redevelopment along the banks of the canal and within the\nsewershed are consistent with recently adopted NYC criteria for on-Site stormwater\ncontrol and green infrastructure.\nResponse #293: The ROD states that current and future high density residential\nredevelopment along the banks of the canal and within the sewershed shall adhere to\nNYC’s rules for sewer connections and shall be consistent with current NYCDEP criteria\nand guidelines to ensure that hazardous substances and solids from additional sewage\nloads do not compromise the effectiveness of the permanent CSO control measures by\nexceeding their design capacity. The ROD also states that the size of the sewage\nretention tanks should be refined during remedial design to ensure that the tanks\naccommodate projected additional loads to the combined sewer system as a result of\ncurrent and future residential development, as well as increased rainfall due to climate\nchange. The EPA will undertake the necessary review and oversight to ensure the\ncontinued protectiveness of the remedy.\nComment #294: A commenter expressed concern that the construction of luxury\nhousing along the canal would increase pressure to push noxious facilities into Red\nHook, especially if new land was created by the proposed CDF. Adding more industry\nto Red Hook would potentially cause more industrial emissions near the ball fields, park\nand nearby public housing and would increase heavy truck traffic in the area.\nResponse #294: The EPA does not have authority over the zoning and planning\napproval for the development of properties along the canal. A CDF will not be\nconstructed.\nDemand Response\nComment #295: Community Board Six inquired whether the EPA can insist that a\n“demand response” campaign be included amongst the proposed remedies to raise\nawareness, affect normative behaviors and include a community action component to\nreduce CSO impacts. The Board also asked whether the EPA can make resources\navailable to implement such a campaign.\nResponse #295: NYCDEP has been generally proactive in informing the community and\ninvolving stakeholders in developing its WWFP and LTCPs throughout NYC and for\nGowanus Canal, in particular. NYCDEP convened a Gowanus Canal\nWaterbody/Watershed Stakeholder Team and followed a community involvement\nprocess that is well documented in its plan report. NYCDEP has performed numerous\noutreach efforts to raise awareness and effect behaviors to reduce CSO impacts for\nV-185\npollutants, such as trash that is discharged as floatables. NYCDEP’s support for water\nconservation provides additional capacity in its sewer systems for reducing CSOs to\nsome extent. While such NYC-lead efforts could be combined with additional state and\nfederal efforts to achieve some level of reductions, these efforts can only effect change\non certain pollutants and contaminant discharges. It is unlikely that behavioral\nmodifications alone would be effective enough to appreciably reduce the amounts and\ncharacteristics of solids and contaminants observed by the EPA in the RI and result in\nmeeting the CERCLA goals without further CSO controls.\nUtilities\nComment #296: A commenter suggested that the remedy require the elevation of\nutilities inside the 100-year floodplain surrounding the canal in order to prevent sewage,\noil and other forms of contamination from recontaminating the remedy during a flood or\nstorm surge event.\nResponse #296: The suggested infrastructure change is beyond the scope of the\nremedy and the EPA’s authority. It would need to be addressed by the local\ngovernment.\nGreen Considerations\nComment #297: Several commenters requested that the EPA use the lowest carbon\nfootprint possible.\nResponse #297: The environmental benefits of the remedy will be enhanced by\nconsideration, during the design, of technologies and practices that are sustainable in\naccordance with the EPA Region 2’s Clean and Green Energy Policy and NYSDEC’s\nGreen Remediation Policy.32 This will include consideration of green remediation\ntechnologies and practices.\nComment #298: A commenter noted that there are many cities that are taking measures\nto mitigate CSOs by reducing the contribution of stormwater to the sewers. Two\ncommenters suggested that green infrastructure initiatives be employed at this Site.\nResponse #298: NYC has a commitment to the State under an Administrative Consent\nOrder to undertake green infrastructure projects in the watershed that affects this part of\nthe Gowanus Canal. NYC has estimated that it can achieve a ten percent further\nreduction of CSO inflows over the next ten or 20 years. The EPA supports such use of\ngreen infrastructure generally, and with respect to such Site-related efforts such as the\nSponge Park and green street ends.\n32 See http://epa.gov/region2/superfund/green_remediation and http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/\nremediation_hudson_ pdf/der31.pdf.\nV-186\nInstitutional Controls\nComment #299: ConEd suggested that existing institutional controls (i.e., the New York\nState Department of Health fish consumption advisory for Upper New York Harbor) is\nthe best method to address human health risks from exposure to PCBs in the canal\nbecause the remedy will not reduce these risks to acceptable levels.\nResponse #299: The remedy is expected to result in risk reduction and a greater degree\nof protection for the local fishing community than would be achieved by institutional\ncontrols alone. As noted previously, fishing advisories are not typically a fully effective\nmeans of avoiding risk exposure, particularly in communities with EJ concerns where\nsubsistence fish is practiced. Because the selected remedy will not fully eliminate the\nrisk, the EPA will continue to support the dissemination of the fish advisory-related\ninformation.\nComment #300: NYCDEP noted that no details are provided on the requirements of\ninstitutional controls and there is no cost estimate for them. While some of these items\nwill be relatively inexpensive, others–such as navigational dredging–could be\nsignificant, particularly if the EPA is successful in extending the navigational channel to\nthe head of the canal.\nResponse #300: Dredging solely for navigational purposes is not considered to be an\ninstitutional control. While institutional controls to prevent damage to the cap armor\nlayer by potential future navigational dredging are needed, the cost of obtaining such\ncontrols would not be significant. The FS costs are developed for the purpose of\ncomparing alternatives and are not a detailed project budget.\nWater Supply Contamination Concerns\nComment #301: Given the levels of bacterial and industrial contamination in the\nGowanus Canal, a commenter asked whether there has been or will there be any\ntesting of nearby residential and business tap water for cross-contamination. The\ncommenter also stated that she tested her tap water with a store-bought water testing\nkit. Since the results show elevated levels of pesticides and bacteria, she requested\nthat the water of local residents, especially those located near the pump station, former\nMGP facilities and major CSO outfalls be tested to ensure that there is no potential\nexposure pathway being generated from local contaminated groundwater impacting the\ndrinking water supply.\nResponse #301: Water distribution systems are under pressure. As a result, water can\nleak out of the pipes, but infiltration of contaminants into the system from groundwater\nand CSOs is virtually impossible. Therefore, with the exception of water main breaks\n(where special procedures are employed to prevent water contamination),\ncontamination of the water supply system from external sources is virtually impossible.\nV-187\nIn order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the EPA and NYSDOH prescribe\nregulations that tell water suppliers what to monitor for and limit the amount of certain\ncontaminants in water provided by public water systems.33 Contaminants are monitored\nfor microbial presence, turbidity, inorganic chemicals (i.e., lead), organic chemicals (i.e.,\npesticides and herbicides) and radioactive material. To comply with these\nrequirements, NYCDEP has an extensive monitoring system in place to ensure that the\ndrinking water meets all federal and state standards.\nThe National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and the NYSDOH Sanitary Code\nrequire suppliers of drinking water to prepare an Annual Water Supply and Quality\nReport. The purpose of this report is to provide the public with an annual statement\nregarding the quality of their drinking water. The latest NYCDEP report, 2012 Drinking\nWater Supply and Quality Report, which can be found using the following link:\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate12.pdf. As can be seen by the table on page\n10, NYC is meeting the applicable standards.\nConcerns Related to New York City and National Grid\nComment #302: A commenter stated that it is common knowledge that the EPA met\nwith officials from the Bloomberg administration and National Grid, both in New York\nand in Washington, and that those meetings influenced the remedy proposed in the\nProposed Plan. The commenter requested that details of these meetings be shared\nwith the public.\nResponse #302: While the EPA had numerous meetings with NYCDEP and National\nGrid in the months prior to the release of the Proposed Plan to discuss technical issues\nrelated to the Site, their independent sampling efforts and their concerns about certain\naspects of the remedial alternatives that were presented in the FS report, the remedy\nfor the cleanup of the canal that was proposed in the Proposed Plan document was\ndeveloped by the EPA alone with input from NYSDEC, not NYCDEP or National Grid.\nPresentations, correspondence and reports submitted to the EPA by the PRPs are\nincluded in the Administrative Record. During periodic meetings with the CAG, the EPA\nproject team provided overviews of its meetings with the PRPs. In addition, members of\nthe CAG and the public participated in meetings with officials from the EPA, NYSDEC,\nNYCDEP and National Grid.\nThe volume of comments on the Proposed Plan submitted by NYCDEP and National\nGrid attest to the fact that they have numerous objections to the EPA’s proposed\nremedy (which would not be the case if NYCDEP and National Grid had unduly\ninfluenced the remedy proposed in the Proposed Plan).\n33 It should be noted that drinking water may reasonably be expected to contain small amounts\nof some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water\nposes a health risk.\nV-188\nComment #303: A commenter opined that NYC and National Grid can never be trusted\nto do a proper cleanup. The commenter suggested that the EPA take over the cleanup\nof the contaminated upland properties and make NYC and National Grid pay for the\ncleanups.\nResponse #303: When viable PRPs are able and willing to perform remedial work, it is\nthe EPA’s policy to let the PRPs perform the work under an appropriate enforcement\nagreement. Based on the results of the EPA's RI, several NYC-owned upland areas\nwere found to have the potential to contribute contamination to the canal and were\nreferred to NYSDEC for investigation and, if necessary, remediation under the State\nSuperfund program. The investigation and remediation of the former MGP facilities, as\nwell as the long-term control planning and CSO control measures under the CWA are\nbeing performed under NYSDEC oversight. In addition, it is anticipated that any\ninvestigation and remediation of NYC-owned upland properties will be performed under\nNYSDEC oversight. In the unlikely event that a timely and effective State-selected\nremedy is not implemented at any upland site, the EPA may implement actions\npursuant to CERCLA to ensure the protectiveness of the selected remedy.\nComment #304: A commenter asked whether the EPA believes that NYC has done an\nappropriate job in keeping the canal clean.\nResponse #304: Clearly, the Gowanus Canal is not clean. In fact, the Gowanus Canal\nhas served as an open sewer since it was initially constructed in the late 1860s. As a\nresult of the poor environmental practices typical of the era, large quantities of wastes\nfrom many of these operations were discharged directly into the canal. By the late\n1870s, sewers entering the canal carried a combination of household waste, industrial\neffluent from the former MGP facilities and other industries and stormwater runoff.\nWhile direct discharges to the canal from industrial activities were substantially reduced\nor controlled over time because of declining industrial activity and the implementation of\nthe CWA in the early 1970s, discharges from upland contaminated areas adjacent to\nthe canal, CSOs, storm sewers and unpermitted pipe outfalls continue to contribute\ncontaminants to the canal. While CSOs are a very visible source of contamination to\nthe canal, they are not the only source of contamination to the canal.\nNYSDEC is currently overseeing work being performed by NYCDEP to reduce CSOs to\nthe canal by approximately 34 percent. These reductions, however, affect only the mid-\nand lower canal CSO outfalls. Annual CSO discharges from outfalls at the upper\nportion of the canal will still contribute approximately 97 percent of the total annual CSO\nflow into the canal. To prevent recontamination of the canal by hazardous substances,\nCSO control measures for the upper reach of the canal need to be implemented under\nCERCLA.\nV-189\nLitter and Debris\nComment #305: A commenter asked how the garbage and litter will be removed from\nthe canal.\nResponse #305: Urban waterways often have significant quantities of debris and\noversized materials, such as cobbles, bricks, large rocks, tires, cables, bicycles,\nshopping carts, steel drums, timbers and automobiles located in the bottom sediments.\nOversized debris that could impede the dredging will be removed before the dredging\ncommences. Debris removal would likely be performed using an excavator positioned\non a barge. Larger debris might require removal using a crane and clamshell bucket.\nSmaller debris will be screened out after dredging. Although garbage and litter will not\nbe actively sought, it is likely that items located on the bottom of the canal will be\ncaptured in the dredging process.\nComment #306: A commenter asked how litter will be kept out of the canal after the\nremediation is completed.\nResponse #306: Much of the litter that ends up in the canal is washed off of the ground\nsurface during storm events. Addressing the CSOs will prevent much additional litter\nfrom being washed into the canal. Work being performed by NYC under the CWA is\nexpected to result in additional controls of floatables.\nEnvironmental Justice\nComment #307: A commenter asked the EPA take into consideration and examine the\nGowanus and Red Hook communities as potential EJ communities. Accordingly, the\nROD would need to include an EJ assessment with a Community Involvement Plan\n(CIP) geared toward the needs of those communities.\nResponse #307: The EPA defines EJ as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement\nof all people regardless of race, color, national origin or income with respect to the\ndevelopment, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and\npolicies. The EPA recognizes the Red Hook area is an area with EJ concerns. An EJ\nassessment is included in the ROD and a CIP has been prepared. As noted further\nbelow, the EPA believes that the selected remedy will result in significant reductions in\nenvironmental exposure to all of the affected communities near the canal, including the\ncommunities with EJ concerns.\nComment #308: A commenter opined that the EPA should conduct an analysis of the\nburden on the EJ community with respect to installing a sewage retention tank at the\nformer Fulton MGP State Superfund site and constructing a CDF. Two commenters\nstated that the EPA should assess the need to modify the implementation of the\nselected remedy to minimize any disproportionately high and adverse environmental\nburdens impacting the EJ community. Two commenters opined that the EPA should\nminimize any disproportionately high and adverse environmental burdens impacting\nV-190\ncommunities with EJ concerns and the environmental burdens should be shared by all\nof the communities along the canal. Another commenter opined that since much of the\nEJ community lives in close proximity to the upland facilities, the EPA should minimize\nany adverse environmental burdens to the communities with EF concerns and the\nimpacts to their daily lives and businesses. The commenter further opined that unless\nthe affected residents are involved in the planning, they will suffer health risks and\ndisruptions associated with the cleanup without any benefit. Two commenters noted\nthat concerns about affordable housing and gentrification will grow for the majority of the\npopulation in the area as the cleanup progresses. A commenter expressed the belief\nthat there should be federal monitoring of demographic shifts that take place as a result\nof the remediation and support for a broader community involvement can focus on these\nissues.\nResponse #308: While the implementation of the remedy in the canal might present\nvarious short-term construction-related impacts to the entire Gowanus Canal community\nas a result of increased traffic on the roads, more frequent opening of the drawbridges\nand noise and the implementation of the remedies in the upland areas might present\nshort-term impacts to those living adjacent to those areas as a result of increased traffic\non the roads and noise, the actions will be performed in such a way as to not present an\nenvironmental burden on the community in terms of exposure to contaminants. In\naddition, the completed remediation efforts at the upland facilities and in the canal will\nnot present a long-term adverse environmental burden on any portion of the community.\nThe EPA believes that the remediation of the canal will reduce the environmental\nburdens on the communities with EJ concerns, as well as the other residents and users\nof the canal area. Project benefits will include reduced contaminant levels in fish\nconsumed by subsistence fishermen, removal of hazardous substances in sediment\nand upland areas and reductions in sewage discharges impacting the canal and\nsurrounding areas during flooding.\nThe EPA acknowledges the desire of the community to minimize and distribute the\nburdens associated with comprehensively addressing the long-standing canal\ncontamination currently impacting the various neighborhoods. As a practical matter,\ntemporary project impacts related to the dredging, CSO controls, remediation of the\nthree former MGP facilities and other project-related work will necessarily occur\nthroughout the length of the canal. For example, the former MGP facilities are roughly\nlocated at the upper, middle and lower ends of the canal. Non-former MGP facilities\nrequiring cleanup are also distributed throughout the area. Dredging will occur over the\nlength of the canal. Approximately 50% of the volume of sediment to be removed is in\nthe lower reach, adjacent to Red Hook. The contemplated CSO retention tanks are\nlocated in the upper and middle reach of the canal.\nThe EPA intends to continue to keep the public informed as to what is going on and\nwhat is planned at the Site via its website and community meetings.\nOne of the objectives of remediating hazardous waste sites is to restore them to\nproductive use. The EPA has no control over the availability of affordable housing and\nV-191\nany gentrification that may occur as a result of the remediation of the canal and upland\nareas. The nature of the post-remediation use of the upland areas will be determined\nby local authorities.\nJob Opportunities\nComment #309: Several commenters asked about the type and number of jobs that the\nCDF would create and what kind of training would be necessary for those jobs. A\ncommenter suggested that the cleanup contractor work with local agencies, schools,\nunions and other training providers to train as many local workers as possible to\nalleviate local unemployment. A commenter suggested that the approximate $500\nmillion investment in cleaning up the canal should be leveraged to benefit local low and\nmoderate income residents with barriers to employment. The commenter suggested\nfurther that the cleanup plan specifically commit to this goal through the JTI. Another\ncommenter noted that offering employment exclusively to people who live in a particular\narea violates equal employment opportunity laws.\nResponse #309: Although a CDF will not be constructed, substantial work will still occur.\nEvery construction project creates jobs. At the time of the stimulus program two years\nago, the President's Council of Economic Advisors estimated that one job is created for\nevery hundred thousand dollars of construction work. Therefore, a project of this size\nwould be expected to generate a number of jobs. Based on the EPA’s experience in\nthe Superfund program, construction jobs for Superfund project typically utilize 70 to 80\npercent local workers, particularly for construction jobs that are going to last for several\nyears. Union jobs are also usually filled on a local basis.\nThe EPA has been a strong supporter of job training initiatives for people who find it\ndifficult to get into the work force because of inadequate education or personal\ndifficulties, such as a criminal record. Through the Job Training Institute (JTI) at the\nPassaic River and Onondaga Lake Superfund facilities, specialized job training was\nprovided and the PRPs encouraged their contractors to hire from that program. The\nEPA anticipates supporting a similar job training program at the Site. National Grid, one\nof the PRPs for this Site, has been a strong supporter of an existing job training\nprogram in Brooklyn.\nThe EPA cannot identify precisely what kind of jobs would have been created related to\nthe CDF or the other components of the remedy. Graduates of JTI would, however, be\nable to fill mostly entry level jobs, such as Site security, traffic control and air and noise\nmonitoring.\nWhile the EPA does not have the authority to compel the PRPs to hire locally or hire\nfrom the portion of the community that is disadvantaged, the EPA is committed to\nencouraging the PRPs to do so.\nV-192\nAvailability of Data in Usable Format\nComment #310: A commenter complained that since the charts and tables in the RI/FS\nreports are presented in Portable Document Format (PDF), performing any analysis of\nthe data requires parsing the PDF into a usable format, which can be time consuming\nand inevitably increases the likelihood of transcription errors. The commenter\nsuggested that the data be made available in a more data-friendly format.\nResponse #310: The RI/FS reports, including the charts and tables, were presented in\nPDF format on the EPA’s website and the compact disc in the repositories to facilitate\nthe public’s review of these documents. The original tables and figures were prepared\nusing Excel. These files are available on the EPA’s website (see http://www.epa.\ngov/region2/superfund/npl/gowanus/ri_docs.html).\nGeneral Concerns\nComment #311: Two commenters indicated that their primary environmental concerns\nwith respect to the canal were the coal tars in the upland former MPG facilities, the\nquality of the water in the canal and persistent localized flooding in the area adjacent to\nthe canal that also resulted in sewer backups into the basements of homes along the\ncanal. The commenters expressed disappointment with the fact that CERCLA was not\ndesigned to directly address these problems other than the coal tars.\nResponse #311: The purpose of CERCLA is to address uncontrolled hazardous waste\nreleases; the law is not designed to address every environmental problem. The EPA is\nconfident that the former MGP facilities will be properly addressed under the State\nSuperfund and Brownfield Cleanup programs by National Grid. CSO controls, to the\nextent additional controls are needed beyond those required for the canal remedy,\nshould be addressed under the CWA LTCP.\nComment #312: Two commenters expressed concern that the increased barge traffic in\nthe canal related to the remediation will require more frequent opening of the\ndrawbridges, resulting in massive traffic jams. The commenters also expressed\nconcern that the dredging and capping effort would impact recreational boating for\nseveral years.\nResponse #312: The use of barges and other project-related watercraft (for sampling,\nsupport, etc.) during project operations will impact the use of other commercial and\nrecreational water-based traffic on the canal and will impact road traffic through more\nfrequent opening of the drawbridges. Although the EPA will, in collaboration with the\nPRPs and the public, develop plans during the remedial design to mitigate such impacts\nto the extent possible, these impacts cannot be fully eliminated.\nV-193\nComment #313: A commenter opined that coordination with the NYSDEC-supervised\ncleanups of the former Fulton, Citizens and Metropolitan MGP facilities and other\ncontaminated properties along the canal, coordination with the USACE on shoreline and\nbulkhead restoration post cleanup and NYC-wide CSO control efforts under the CWA\nand the 2012 CSO administrative consent order between NYC and NYSDEC are\ncritically important to the success of the cleanup.\nResponse #313: The EPA is aware of the need to coordinate the cleanup of the former\nMGP facilities and other contaminated properties along the canal with NYSDEC,\ncoordinate the NYCDEP-performed CSO control efforts with NYCDEP and NYSDEC\nand coordinate post-remediation shoreline and bulkhead restoration with the USACE,\nNYSDEC and NYCDEP.\nThe cleanup of the former MGP facilities will be completed in accordance with\nschedules agreed upon between the EPA and NYSDEC to insure that releases from the\nformer MGP facilities are controlled in a timely enough manner so as not to affect the\nintegrity of the canal remedy.\nThe EPA and NYSDEC are committed to working with NYCDEP throughout the\nremedial design to ensure that the Superfund remedy is implemented in a timely\nmanner and that the CWA goals are met cost-effectively to the extent that the LTCP\ndevelopment can proceed contemporaneously.\nThe EPA has prepared a series of approaches to coordinate and expedite bulkhead\nreplacement regardless of the extent to which such bulkhead replacement is part of the\nremedy. The EPA has already held talks with the USACE, NYSDEC and NYC about\ncooperative approaches to address bulkhead replacement and restoration along the\ncanal.\nComment #314: A commenter complained that National Grid’s website, for the former\nFulton MGP State Superfund site, which is supposed to provide regular facility news\nand updates, has not been updated since September 2012. The commenter also\ncomplained that, contrary to the updating requirements of 6 NYCRR Part 375-1. 10, the\nCitizen Participation Plan for the facility is more than five years old.\nResponse #314: Since the Public Place and Fulton former MGP facilities are being\naddressed under state authorities, the complaints were passed on to NYSDEC.\nComment #315: A commenter suggested that the EPA adopt a “Notify NYC” system to\nquickly notify the public of any potential health and safety concerns regarding the\nGowanus Canal cleanup, including but not limited to, flooding, air quality, accidents and\nspills that may occur under any of the responsible parties or agencies involved in the\ncleanup.\nResponse #315: Protocols for the notification of the public of potential health and safety\nconcerns related to the Gowanus Canal remediation will be developed during the design\nwith public input and will be incorporated into a Site-specific health and safety plan.\nV-194\nReferences\nThe technical references cited below, as well as in the EPA’s Proposed Plan, RI, FS\nand FS Addendum reports, if not otherwise directly included in the administrative record\nfor the Site, are incorporated by reference.\nAnchor QEA, 2012.

(GEI), in collaboration with Mutch\nAssociates, LLC, developed a three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model (computer\nmodel) to be used for predicting hydraulic effects of potential remedial alternatives in support\nof remedy selection.\nThe model is a representation of hydraulic conditions within the aquifer system at the Site and\nthe surrounding region. This report includes a description of the model, and guidance and\nrecommendations for its use in predicting the hydraulic effects of potential remedial\nalternatives. The key model output parameters consist of water table elevation, potentiometric\nhead, flow direction, velocity, and base flow rate to the canal. The model was calibrated to\npresent-day conditions in the aquifer system. The objective functions of the model consist of:\n Quantitative estimate of present day (baseline) groundwater flow conditions.\n Quantitative prediction of groundwater flow after remedy implementation for\ncomparison to specified constraints.\n Comparative evaluation of potential remedial alternatives and design variables to\noptimize efficiency and, if necessary, mitigate potential adverse hydraulic effects of\npotential remedial alternatives.\nThe model is a representation of the portion of the regional aquifer that is hydraulically\nconnected to the canal. The modeled aquifer system includes a shallow (water table) unit,\noutwash sand and till unit (Upper Glacial Aquifer), and an underlying gravel aquifer unit\n(Jameco Gravel). The water table and Upper Glacial Aquifer units are separated in the area of\nthe Site by a marsh deposit aquitard. Shallow groundwater on Site is generally perched above\nthe marsh deposits, and discharges to the Gowanus Canal horizontally through permeable\nbulkheads. Groundwater discharge from the Upper Glacial Aquifer to the canal is generally\nupward through sediments. The Upper Glacial Aquifer and Jameco Gravel are separated in\nsome locations by the Gardiners Clay confining unit. Groundwater within the Jameco Gravel\nflows upward into the Upper Glacial Aquifer in areas where the Gardiners Clay is thin, absent,\nor is comprised primarily of sand.\nThe model was developed to simulate the anticipated potential remedial components of\nsediment dredging, sediment capping, in-situ stabilization, and adjacent bulkhead\nimprovements. The model can also accommodate supplemental or ancillary systems such as\nupland capping, relief drains, and groundwater extraction. As groundwater processes\nassociated with remedial components would be identified as part of the FS, a computer model\niv\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nassists in quantifying the processes. The model was developed to quantitatively predict\nchanges in water table elevation, groundwater flow direction, base flow, groundwater\nvelocities, and potentiometric head changes in the regional aquifer system. Evaluation of the\nnature of these processes is essential to understanding the present and future behavior of\ngroundwater within and near the canal. Proceeding without modeling would preclude being\nable to predict the effects of the remediation project on water quality and the water table\nelevation following remediation. Recommendations are provided as to how remedial system\ncomponents may be included in the model, and how output can be interpreted to assist EPA in\nselecting the most appropriate, effective, and sustainable solution to the issues in the Gowanus\nCanal.\nThe approximately 1.8-mile-long canal is abutted by 80 parcels owned variously by 64 public\nand private entities. Given the large size of the Site and number of abutting properties physical\nconstraints and timelines for remedy implementation are expected to vary by location within\nthe Site . The model was developed to simulate multiple systems under multiple timelines as\npart of a holistic approach to Site remediation. The model can be used to evaluate system\nredundancy, interferences, and adverse effects associated with a remedy comprised of multiple\ncomponents.\nThe model was developed using site-specific data collected from USEPA’s Remedial\nInvestigation (RI) of the Site, National Grid’s investigations of former Manufactured Gas Plant\n(MGP) sites abutting the canal, and regional geologic and hydrogeologic data obtained from\nthe USGS and other published sources. The model was calibrated to a groundwater elevation\ndata set representing present conditions. The data set was seasonal- and tidal-averaged to\nrepresent long-term steady state conditions. Site and regional groundwater elevation data\nindicate that groundwater elevations in the regional aquifer system have remained relatively\nconstant over the past two decades. Site groundwater elevation measurements showed no\nsignificant changes in groundwater flow patterns relative to the tide cycle or seasonal\nfluctuations. The calibrated model was validated by modeling historic pumping and drought\nevents, and confirming that the calculated groundwater elevations were consistent with\nhistorically documented groundwater elevations.\nThis report presents quantitative output from the calibrated model to support risk\ncharacterization and hydrodynamic modeling for the Site. The model calculates a net base\nflow to the canal of 675 gallons per minute. Model-calculated localized upward head potential\nand base flow are also presented in this report. The area of contribution to the canal is an\napproximate 2.8 square mile area centered about ½ mile east of the Site.\nv\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n1. Introduction\nOn behalf of National Grid, GEI Consultants, Inc. (GEI), in collaboration with Mutch\nAssociates, LLC, developed and calibrated a numerical groundwater flow model for the area of\nthe Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York (the Site, Figure 1-1). The model was developed\nto characterize the relationship of the canal to the surrounding aquifer, and to provide a model\nfor use in evaluating remedial alternatives for the canal and abutting sites. The purposes of this\nreport are to document the groundwater model and its calibration, and to provide a quantitative\ndescription of present-day groundwater flow to serve as a baseline for risk assessment and\nfuture remediation scenarios.\nThe work was done in accordance with the Groundwater Model Work Plan transmitted to\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on September 13, 2010 by National\nGrid [GEI, 2010]. The work was performed by GEI between September 2010 and October\n2011. This report is being submitted to the USEPA for inclusion in the Administrative Record\nfor the Gowanus Canal to provide an evaluation tool for use in screening and guiding the\nselection of potential remedial alternatives.\nThis report is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the structure of the\nmodel and its boundary conditions. Section 3 describes the model calibration. Section 4\ndescribes the sensitivity analysis. Section 5 describes model validation. Section 6 provides\nfindings and recommendations for use of the model in support of risk assessment and potential\nremedial alternatives for the canal and abutting sites.\n1\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n2. Model Description\nA three-dimensional groundwater model was constructed using Visual MODFLOW version\n2010.0 from Schlumberger Water Services (SWS). MODFLOW is an industry standard\nprogram used for numerical groundwater modeling, developed by the United States Geological\nSurvey (USGS) [McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988]. MODFLOW is a modular finite-difference\nflow model, which is a computer code that solves the general groundwater flow partial\ndifferential equation. The groundwater flow equation is a mathematical relationship which is\nused to describe the flow of groundwater through an aquifer. Visual MODFLOW is a\ngraphical user interface which facilitates model input and output. The model domain is\ndiscretized into a number of three-dimensional blocks (rectangular cells) and boundary\nconditions are applied. For each cell, MODFLOW computes the hydraulic head using a\nnumber of hydrogeologic input parameters such as hydraulic conductivity. The site\nMODFLOW model was run in steady-state mode. In steady-state mode, model inflows,\noutflows, and heads do not vary over time. Steady-state results consist of a single flow field\nrepresenting a stable condition over time. Three-dimensional particle tracking was used in the\nmodel to depict the predicted flow paths and velocities within the steady-state flow field.\nElevations in the model are relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD).\n2.1 Conceptual Site Model\nA conceptual site model (CSM) was developed to describe regional and local groundwater\nflow for the purpose of constructing the model and defining boundary conditions. The CSM\nwas developed using information obtained during Remedial Investigation for activities for the\nGowanus Canal Site, abutting former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) sites, and regional\npublications as cited below.\nThe model area is shown in Figure 2-1. Groundwater flow within the model area occurs in two\nregional aquifers: The Upper Glacial Aquifer and the Jameco Gravel. Groundwater elevation\ncontours for the Upper Glacial Aquifer reported by USGS are shown in Figure 2-1. The bulk\nof the Upper Glacial Aquifer consists of outwash sand with till lenses, but is also considered to\ninclude overlying post-glacial deposits such as marsh deposits and fill [USGS, 1999]. The\nUpper Glacial Aquifer is separated from the Jameco Gravel by the Gardiners Clay confining\nunit in the eastern portion of the model area. Groundwater flows from the Jameco Gravel\nupward to the Upper Glacial Aquifer through locations where the Gardiners Clay is not\npresent. A conceptual profile of the aquifer components is shown in Figure 2-2.\n2\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nRegional flow in the Upper Glacial and Jameco Gravel Aquifers in the area of the Site is\nwesterly to southwesterly as can be inferred from the regional groundwater contours shown in\nFigure 2-3 [USGS 1997; USGS, 1999]. Groundwater approaching the Site within the Upper\nGlacial Aquifer discharges to the canal or flows relatively parallel to the canal with regional\nflow. Historic measurements shown in Appendix A, Figure A-1 indicate that water levels in\nthe Upper Glacial Aquifer have remained stable over the past decade.\nGroundwater elevation measurements and soil boring observations indicate that the marsh\ndeposits at the Site are a significant confining or semiconfining unit. The water table near the\nSite appears to be mounded (perched) above the marsh deposits. Groundwater elevations at the\nwater table (Figure A-2) in wells screened above the marsh deposits are higher than the\npotentiometric surface observed within the Upper Glacial Aquifer beneath the marsh deposits\n(Figure A-3). The historical extent of the marsh deposits is shown in Figure 2-4. Relatively\nhigh mounding was observed at the former Citizens MGP site, in the area of the former holders\nalong 5th Street, which has been partially attributed to buried debris and structures.\nGroundwater elevation heads in the Jameco Gravel (Fig. A-4) are generally slightly higher than\nheads in the Upper Glacial Aquifer, indicating the potential for upward flow where the Jameco\nGravel is in direct contact with the Upper Glacial Aquifer.\nGroundwater flow in the computer model is controlled by four sources and sinks:\nSources\n Recharge (rain and snowmelt)\n Regional Aquifer\nSinks\n Surface water (Gowanus Canal, East River, Gowanus Bay)\n Regional Aquifer\n Utility corridors\nThe Upper Glacial Aquifer is fed by local recharge and by upward flow from the Jameco\nGravel. The horizontal model limits were defined to represent approximate natural\ngroundwater divides within the Upper Glacial Aquifer. Radially outward flow from the area of\nProspect Park generally dominates the groundwater flow trends within in the eastern portion of\nthe model (Fig. 2-3).\nThe Jameco Gravel is fed by recharge zones in northern Long Island, flows southerly, and\ndischarges at locations within and downgradient of the model area (Fig. 2-3). Within the\nmodel, groundwater in the Jameco Gravel discharges at locations where the Gardiners Clay is\nabsent.\n3\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nUtility corridors that influence the water table are located in the model at the Fulton Former\nMGP Site and in a low-lying area surrounding Wallabout Bay (see Section 2.4.3). Regionally,\nutility infiltration and exfiltration are expected to be present throughout urban areas. The\neffects are assumed to be evenly spread, and as such can be incorporated in the model as part\nof the soil hydraulic conductivity (for infiltration) or as a component of recharge (for\nexfiltration).\nThe regional aquifer system was used historically as a significant water supply source until the\n1960s. As a result of pumping, the water table was drawn down as much as 35 feet within the\nmodel area. The water table has returned to its approximate original elevation (Cartwright,\n2002), and periodic gauging results reported by USGS indicates that water levels have been\nstable over the last decade (USGS, 2011). No active pumping of groundwater is reportedly\noccurring near the Site (Roux Associates, 1990). USGS (1998) reports subway tunnel\ndewatering occurs near the northern model boundary. Localized drawdown in the area of\ndewatering was found to not significantly affect either the modeled regional groundwater flow\nor model calibration.\nThe CSM for the regional aquifer system has five stratigraphic units: fill or native sand at the\nsurface, underlain by the silt/peat marsh deposits (where present), the Upper Glacial Aquifer,\nthe Gardiners Clay, and the Jameco Gravel. Underlying bedrock is assumed to be impervious.\nSoil type and extent of the five stratigraphic units in the model are described in Section 2.5.\nRegional lithology and hydrogeologic conditions were obtained for purposes of developing the\nCSM from Buxton et al. (1981), Cartwright (2002), and EPA (2010b). Strata break elevations\nused in defining model layers were interpreted from Former MGP and Gowanus Canal site\nboring logs (GEI, 2005; EPA, 2010); and historic boring logs compiled by the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) as made available by USGS\n(NYSDEC, 1937; NYSDEC, 1944). Historic soil boring and Former MGP Site locations are\nshown in Figure A-5. Soil boring logs used in development of the model are shown with the\ninterpreted strata break elevations in Table 1. Monitoring well locations for the Gowanus\nCanal and Former MGP investigations are shown in Figures A-2, A-3, and A-4. Model grid\ndevelopment is described in Section 2.3. Each CSM stratigraphic unit was assigned at least\none numerical layer in the computer model. The numerical model grid is shown in plan view\nin Figure 2-5, and in cross-section in Figures 2-6 and 2-7.\nThe Upper Glacial Aquifer was divided into two numerical layers (4 and 5) for vertical\ndiscretization and to allow for partially-penetrating cutoff walls to be modeled in potential\nremediation scenarios. The marsh deposit layer was divided into two numerical layers to\naccommodate sediments beneath the canal, and canal head boundaries above the sediments.\nMODFLOW requires that the layer splits throughout the entire model, for continuity of the\nfinite-difference grid. For strata that are discontinuous within the model (marsh deposits,\nsediments, the Gardiners Clay, and the Jameco Gravel), the numeric layers were extended\n4\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nbeyond the strata extent as described in Section 2.3. The following seven numerical layers\nwere assigned in the numerical model:\n Model Layer 1: Zone above the top of the silt/peat unit (primarily fill in the area of the\ncanal; native sand in upland areas further from the canal.\n Model Layer 2: Marsh deposits where present; open water within the canal, Gowanus\nBay, and the East River; Upper Glacial sand elsewhere.\n Model Layer 3: Same as layer 2, except includes sediments within the canal, Gowanus\nBay, and the East River.\n Model Layers 4 and 5: Upper Glacial Aquifer.\n Model Layer 6: Gardiners Clay where present; Upper Glacial Aquifer elsewhere.\n Model Layer 7: Jameco Gravel where present; Upper Glacial Aquifer elsewhere.\nBedrock observed at the Site is the Fordham Gneiss, which is described as a metamorphosed,\nmedium to coarse-grained igneous rock unit of Precambrian Age (P.C. Brock and P.W.G.\nBrock, 2001). Regional down-warping of bedrock beneath the Site and the vicinity has\nresulted in a southeast-dipping bedrock surface (EPA, 2003; Cartwright, R.A., 2002).\n2.2 Assumptions\nGeneral assumptions inherent to MODFLOW are:\n Groundwater flow occurs within a three-dimensional heterogeneous, anisotropic,\nsaturated porous medium.\n Groundwater flow is laminar.\n Groundwater is incompressible.\nAssumptions used in the development of the groundwater model that are specific to the Site\nare:\n Groundwater flow conditions are at steady-state for calibration purposes.\n The calibration data set and interpreted groundwater flow directions and gradients\nrepresent conditions typical of long-term present-day conditions, and are adequate for\nevaluation and comparison of potential future remedial alternatives.\n The calibration data set is assumed to represent mid-tide conditions. For model\ncalibration purposes, groundwater levels taken at high and low tides were averaged to\nrepresent a mid-tide level. Tidal fluctuations in ground water were measured during the\n2005 Carroll Gardens/Public Place RI and during the 2010 Gowanus Canal RI. Tidal\nfluctuations adjacent to the canal were assumed to not affect net long-term flow\ndirections or discharge rates to the canal.\n5\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n To model the net long-term effect of the canal surface elevation on groundwater, the\nhead boundary within the canal, Gowanus Bay, and the East River was assumed to be\nMean Sea Level.\n The calibration data set includes water level elevations taken during the 2005 Carroll\nGardens/Public Place RI and during the 2010 Gowanus Canal RI. Several monitoring\nwells present in each respective investigation were not present during the other\ninvestigation; therefore, not all wells in the data set could be gauged during the same\nevent. It is assumed that groundwater flow trends have remained stable over this\nperiod, and the calibration data set adequately represents steady state long term\nconditions at the Site for purposes of modeling the long-term effect of remedial systems\non groundwater.\n Each stratigraphic layer can be modeled as a homogeneous and horizontally isotropic\nunit, with the following localized variations in hydraulic conductivity\n- Fill material in the area of the canal consists of sand containing silt, debris, gravel,\nand buried structures. It is assumed that the net effect of this condition can be\nrepresented as zones with varying hydraulic conductivity.\n- The hydraulic effects of inter-bedding (e.g. sand inter-bedded with layers of silt)\nwithin each layer can be approximated in the model by assigning a vertical\nanisotropy to hydraulic conductivity values.\n Temporary variations in canal surface water elevations due to combined sewer\noverflow (CSO) discharges were assumed to not affect the long term static conditions\npresent within the aquifer system.\n It is assumed that bedrock is impermeable and contributes no significant groundwater\nflow or pressure head to the overburden aquifers modeled.\n2.3 Model Grid\nThe model is comprised of a grid 18,400 by 25,250 feet (3.5 by 4.75 miles) in area with depths\nranging from 100 to 250 feet deep as defined by the top of the Fordham Gneiss (Figures 2-5, 2-\n6, and 2-7). Horizontal grid spacing ranges from 23 to 32 feet on site and 460 to 630 feet off\nsite. The grid was designed so that approximately 100-foot-wide canal would have at least five\nmodel cells across its width to model partial dredge or cap scenarios. Vertical grid layer\nthicknesses ranges from 1 to 108 feet, as defined by the stratigraphic units described in\nSection 2.1. A zone of inactive cells was assigned in the northeast corner of the model to\nrepresent a groundwater divide as described in Section 2.4.4.\nThe model grid is defined in North American Datum (NAD) 1983 New York State Plane East.\nThe model axis is rotated 42.5 degrees east of north. The model axis was rotated so that the\ncanal alignment was approximately parallel to the Y-axis.\n6\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nModel layer elevations were defined by mapping the observed top and bottom elevations of\neach stratigraphic unit. For discontinuous units, dummy layer elevation points were assigned\nfor numerical layer continuity where the geological unit is absent. The point elevations were\nimported to MODFLOW to define the numeric layers by interpolation.\n2.4 Boundary Conditions\nBoundary conditions were assigned to represent the sources and sinks sources described in\nSection 2.1 (regional aquifers, canal, utilities, and recharge).\n2.4.1 Constant Head Boundaries\nConstant head boundaries (CHBs) were assigned along the model limits to represent surface\nwater, and the interface with the surrounding regional aquifer system in areas where divides\nwere not considered to be present. Groundwater divides are described in Sections 2.1 and\ndetailed in Section 2.4.4. CHBs consist of potentiometric head elevations assigned to specific\ncells in the model. Groundwater can flow into and out of CHB cells, depending upon whether\nthe neighboring groundwater is under a higher or lower potentiometric head, respectively.\nConstant head cells were assigned in Layer 1 with head values at elev. 0.0 NAVD (Mean Sea\nLevel) within the Gowanus Canal, Gowanus Bay, and the East River (Fig. 2-8). CHB cells\nallow groundwater to enter the canal vertically from cells representing sediments and the\nunderlying aquifer, and horizontally from fill through the bulkhead wall boundary.\nA CHB was assigned along the southeastern model boundary in Layer 4 (Upper Glacial\nAquifer) to represent a southerly component of flow toward Gowanus Bay consistent with\nregional trends. A linear gradient was ranging from head elevation 1.0 to 6.75 NAVD was\nassigned where shown in Figure 2-8.\nCHBs were assigned at the northern and southern extents of the model in the Jameco Gravel\nlayer (Layer 7) to represent flow to and from the regional aquifer. The USGS contours\n(Fig. 2-3) indicate potentiometric heads in the Jameco Gravel at the northern and southern\nmodel limits of approximately 7 and 5 NAVD, respectively. CHBs of 7 and 5 were assigned in\nthe Jameco Gravel near the northern model limit (south of the inactive zone) and the southern\nmodel limit, respectively, where shown in Figure 2-9.\n2.4.2 Recharge\nFour aquifer recharge zones were established for the model, to represent variations in ground\ncover (Fig. 2-10). Aquifer recharge was set at:\n Commercial/Industrial 4 inches/year\n Urban Residential 7 inches/year\n7\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n Urban Undeveloped 9 inches/year\n Parkland 10 inches/year\nThe modeled recharge rates are consistent with estimated recharge rates for urban areas in the\nnortheastern United States. Recharge in undeveloped areas of Long Island was estimated to\nequal about 50 percent of mean annual precipitation, but recharge from precipitation in the\nhighly urbanized and industrialized areas of Kings and Queens Counties is reported to be far\nless because the large amounts of impervious surfaces impede infiltration (Cartwright, 2002).\nBuxton and Shernoff (1995) reported an annual recharge for Kings County of 15 percent of\nprecipitation. Average annual precipitation for the New York City area for the years 1961\nthrough 1991 was reported to be 40 to 50 inches per year [USGS, 2005]. Fifteen percent of\nannual precipitation would yield 6 to 7.5 inches/year of recharge to the aquifer system.\nRecharge rates in the model vary relative to the reported county-wide values to reflect local\nchanges in infiltration rates based on ground cover. Other values reported from studies of\nurban areas in the region are similar, where recharge in urbanized areas near Pennsauken, New\nJersey, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, were reported to range from 0 to 9 inches per year, and\n0.11 to 11 inches per year, respectively [New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\n(NJDEP), 2000; USGS, 2008].\n2.4.3 Drains/Utilities\nDrains and utilities can affect the water table by infiltration or exfiltration. Infiltration may\ninclude leakage of groundwater into utility conduits beneath the water table (leaking pipes,\ncoarse trench backfill, or bedding material). Exfiltration includes leakage from water or sewer\nmains. Two areas of infiltration were included in the model: drainage within the filled-in inlet\nand wetlands around Wallabout Bay, and a sewer main along DeGraw Street near 3rd Avenue\n(Fig. 2-8). Infiltration is modeled as “drain” cells with assigned head elevations, where\nsurrounding groundwater at higher head elevations can enter the drain cells, causing a flow\ngradient toward the drain cells.\nWithin the Wallabout Bay/Navy Yard area, a drain boundary was included to represent\ndrainage occurring within a backfilled former inlet and wetlands. The lower observed water\ntable near Wallabout Bay may also be a result of higher-conductivity fill in the area allowing\nthe water table to equalize with surface water elevations in the East River. The drain cells\nwere assigned an elevation value of 1.0 NAVD, to represent the water table approaching sea\nlevel in the area. Drain cells would have the same effect on regional flow in the model as\nrelatively high conductivity fill in the area, which is to create a groundwater divide north of the\ncanal.\nGroundwater elevations in three monitoring wells near a 36-inch sewer along DeGraw Street\nwere relatively low, based on observed drawdown trends. Groundwater elevations observed at\nmonitoring wells FW-MW05, MW-MW5R, and FW-MW12 approach elevation 4 NAVD,\n8\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nindicating a relatively flat water table along DeGraw Street. A line of cells was assigned an\nelevation value of 4.0 NAVD along the segment of DeGraw Street shown in Figure 2-8, to\nrepresent drainage into the sewer.\nInfiltration/exfiltration is common in urban areas, and is expected to occur throughout most of\nthe model area. USGS reports that aquifers in urban areas may gain 3 inches per year as\nartificial returns. Other than Wallabout Bay and the DeGraw Street sewer, no evidence of\nrelatively high infiltration or exfiltration was apparent in the model area, based on observed\ngroundwater elevations. It is assumed that background levels of infiltration/exfiltration are\nuniformly distributed within the model. Background levels of infiltration would be accounted\nfor in the model as part of the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values in fill. Background\nlevels of exfiltration would be accounted for as part of the calibrated areal recharge rates.\n2.4.4 No-Flow (Inactive) Boundaries\nNo-Flow (Inactive) boundaries are located at the model limits where no head boundaries are\npresent, and at the base of the model. At the model limits and the base of the model, where\nhead boundaries are not present, no groundwater flow occurs in or out of the model. Flow\noccurs parallel to or radially outward from the inactive boundaries.\nThe western model limit is inactive, where outward (easterly) flow occurs because recharge\naccrues along the model limit and can only flow parallel to or away from the model limit.\nAlong the eastern model limit, groundwater flows radially outward, representing regional flow\nas shown in Figure 2-3. Along the northern model limit, flow is generally outward,\nrepresenting regional flow toward Wallabout Bay. The northeastern corner of the model is\ninactive, to represent a regional divide to the north. Groundwater north of the model flows\nnorth or northwesterly away from the terminal moraine, towards the East River or the\nNewtown Creek basin.\nThe western, northwestern, and southwestern portions of the model located within Gowanus\nBay, the East River, Governor’s Island, and Manhattan are inactive boundaries. Groundwater\nelevations in these areas of the model are controlled by the constant head boundaries\nrepresenting surface water. Groundwater flows outward from these boundaries toward the East\nRiver. The East River is assumed to be a groundwater divide. The southern model boundary\nwithin Gowanus Bay and the lower East River was placed far enough from the canal such that\nany sea bed discharges from the Site occurs within the model.\nBedrock is modeled as an inactive boundary. The top of bedrock comprises the base of the\nmodel. Bedrock is considered to be a relatively impermeable crystalline metamorphic rock,\nwith water contained in joints and fracture zones (USGS, 1998). Groundwater flow occurs\nalong or upward from the base of the model, driven primarily by head boundaries assigned in\nthe Jameco Gravel.\n9\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n2.4.5 Bulkheads\nBulkheads along the Gowanus Canal may inhibit groundwater flow to and from the canal,\nwhere the bulkhead materials are less permeable than the adjacent upland soil. Bulkheads\nalong the canal are modeled as Horizontal Flow Boundaries (“wall” boundaries). Wall\nboundaries were placed in the model between cells representing the canal (and sediments), and\ncells representing upland soil. Hydraulic conductivities were assigned to the bulkhead, and\nadjusted as calibration parameters.\nThe bulkhead boundary structure relative to the canal and sediment model cells is illustrated in\nFigure 2-11. Groundwater enters the canal by three mechanisms:\n Upland of the canal above the mudline elevation, groundwater flows horizontally from\nfill adjacent to the bulkhead, through the wall boundary and into cells representing\ncanal surface water.\n Upland of the canal beneath the mudline elevation, groundwater can flow horizontally\nfrom marsh deposits through the wall boundary, then into cells representing sediments,\nthen upward into cells representing canal surface water.\n Beneath the canal sediments, groundwater from the regional aquifer can flow upward\nthrough the sediments then into cells representing surface water.\nGroundwater entering CHB cells exit the computational model. The flow rate into the canal as\ncalculated by MODFLOW represents the model-calculated estimate of groundwater flow from\nthe aquifer system to the canal.\nThe bulkheads along the canal are constructed of various materials and include timber\ncribbing, timber sheet piling, riprap embankments, and steel sheet piling (NEA, 2004). The\nbulkhead conductivities assigned in the model represents the net effect of three processes\npotentially occurring along the bulkhead:\n Groundwater leakage through cribbing, between timbers, and through sheet pile joints.\n Decreases of leakage due to siltation within the bulkhead, and increases of leakage due\nto channeling or washing out of silt or fine-grained material.\n Increase of leakage due to potential historic removal or partial removal of marsh\ndeposits during bulkhead construction.\nHydraulic conductivities for the bulkhead were assigned during the calibration process.\nDuring model calibration, bulkhead hydraulic conductivities were adjusted so that the\nmodel-calculated heads for monitoring wells screened in fill near the canal matched the\nobserved heads. Bulkhead conductivities in the model range between 0.001 and 10 ft/day.\nFigure 2-12 depicts the modeled bulkhead conductivity in plan view.\n10\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nIn general, observed heads in shallow wells near the bulkheads ranged from elevation 2 to 3,\nindicating moderate resistance to flow toward the CHB of zero NAVD water-side of the\nbulkhead (Fig. A-2). Figure 2-11 illustrates idealized water table behavior relative to bulkhead\nconductivity. Shallow wells adjacent to the bulkhead with lower observed head elevations (1\nto 2 ft NAVD) and strong tidal response, where the marsh deposit aquitard is present, indicate\na higher-permeability bulkhead.\n2.4.6 Supply Pumping\nNo supply pumping was included in the model. Roux Associates, Inc. (1990) reported that\nthere are no public or private water supply wells within a 3-mile radius of the Citizens Former\nMGP site. The NYSDEC Phase II Report prepared by Roux Associates, Inc. cites the New\nYork State Department of Health (NYSDOH) New York State Atlas of Community Water\nSystems Sources 1982 as the source of this information. A USGS model for water supply\npumping on Long Island indicates that ongoing subway tunnel dewatering occurs in the area of\ndowntown Brooklyn, near the northern model boundary (USGS, 1998). The subway system is\nlocated outside the zone of groundwater contribution to the canal (Section 6.1.2). Model\ncalibration is not sensitive to localized drawdown in the area of reported dewatering. USGS\n(1998) reports that ongoing supply pumping in Kings and Queens counties presently occurs in\neastern areas of the counties, outside the model area to the north and northeast.\n2.5 Hydraulic Conductivity\nHydraulic conductivities were assigned to each stratigraphic unit as listed in Table 2. The\nspatial location of assigned hydraulic conductivities for each layer are shown in Figures 2-13\nthrough 2-20. Figure 2-21 is a cut-away view showing the model structure with conductivity\nzones along the canal. Cross-sections of the model showing hydraulic conductivity zones are\nshown in Figures 2-22 and 2-23. Hydraulic conductivities were selected based on slug test\nresults, published values for the regional formations, published ranges for the observed soil\ntypes [Anderson, 1992; USGS, 1999], and calibration of the model to observed water level\nelevations. Hydraulic conductivity values used in the model are listed with slug test results and\npublished values in Table 2. In general, the water table mounding and variability in water level\nelevations in the shallow groundwater zone on Site is attributed to a combination of areal\nrecharge, fill heterogeneity, and variability in bulkhead permeability along the canal. In the\nintermediate and deep zones of the Upper Glacial Aquifer, and within the Jameco Gravel, less\nspatial variability was observed in observed potentiometric heads (e.g. a flatter potentiometric\nsurface was apparent), indicative of relatively higher permeability soil.\n2.5.1 Fill/Shallow Sand\nThe area of the Gowanus Creek was artificially filled as part of the construction of the\nGowanus Canal in the 1860s. In the area of the canal, above the marsh deposits, fill consists of\n11\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nloose, non-cohesive silt, sand and little gravel mixed with brick, concrete, coal, wood, metal,\nash, and clinkers. Within portions of the Citizens Former MGP site, fill also contains concrete\ndebris and foundation remnants from the former facility. We assumed that fill within other\nindustrialized areas within the model are of a similar nature, and that in residential areas, fill is\ncomprised mainly of reworked native sand. At relatively high topographic elevations including\nCobble Hill and Prospect Hill, the nature of the fill within the model is not significant because\nfill would be located above the water table.\nA uniform hydraulic conductivity of 10 ft/day (horizontal) and 1 ft/day (vertical) was assigned\nto most of the upper layer of the model to represent fill, or the upper fringe of native soil\noutside the limits of the filled-in former wetlands complex. Localized areas of fill, referred to\nherein as subunits, near the canal were assigned different conductivity values during model\ncalibration (Section 3.1). Hydraulic conductivities assigned to the subunits range from 0.1 to\n35 ft/day. The conductivity values used are consistent with literature values for soil ranging\nfrom silty sand to medium-coarse sand (Anderson, 1992). The lower values reflect areas\nwhere higher water table elevations were observed, where the rate of groundwater travel is\nrelatively limited due to lower hydraulic conductivity. The higher values reflect areas where\nthe observed water table is flatter, because water can easily travel between the gravel particles.\nAs a result, groundwater elevations within relatively coarse material tend to equalize with\npotentiometric heads at downgradient discharge points, and the water table becomes relatively\nflat. In addition to the fill subunits in Layer 1, an apparent till deposit north and northeast of\nthe canal was assigned a lower conductivity value as described in Section 2.5.3.\n2.5.2 Marsh Deposits/Sediments\nMarsh deposits consisting of silt, clay, peat, and sand are represented in the model within\nformer wetland areas. Prior to development, wetlands were located around the Gowanus\nCanal, the southern end of the Red Hook neighborhood, and Wallabout Bay, as shown in\nFigure 2-4. The modeled extent of silt/peat marsh deposits shown in Figures 2-14 and 2-15 can\nbe compared to the mapped extent shown in Figure 2-4.\nThe marsh deposits are modeled as a semiconfining unit with relatively low hydraulic\nconductivity. Water table elevations above the marsh deposits (potentiometric heads ranging\nin elevation from 3 to 10 ft.) are higher than the potentiometric surface beneath the marsh\ndeposits (elevation heads approximately 1 to 3 ft.). The generally higher overlying water table\nelevation is indicative that the marsh deposits function as a semiconfining unit. The absence of\nthe water table mound outside the marsh deposit footprint (the northwest corner of the Citizens\nFormer MGP site and the southwestern area of the Fulton Works Former MGP site), suggests\nthat recharge retained above the marsh deposits contributes to the formation and stability of the\nhigher water table.\n12\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nCanal sediments include soft recent organic deposits and, where present, underlying native silt\nand peat. In the model, the sediment column is represented as a single layer. Model cells\nwithin the sediment layer were assigned hydraulic conductivity values that were determined\nbased on presence or absence of underlying native silt and peat, and whether evidence of local\ngroundwater upwelling was apparent based on potentiometric heads in adjacent wells screened\nin the Upper Glacial Aquifer. Evidence of local groundwater upwelling was considered to be\napparent at locations where observed potentiometric heads within the Upper Glacial Aquifer\nwere relatively low.\nSediment core data indicates that marsh deposits are variably present beneath the canal (Figure\n2-11) [GEI, 2009; EPA, 2011]. Native silt and peat was generally present beneath the southern\ntwo-thirds of the canal (south of 3rd Street). The silt and peat was absent in borings beneath the\ncanal North of 3rd Street, adjacent to the Red Hook area, and near 4th Street. The areas where\nnative peat and silt are absent were assumed to have been removed by dredging. In the three\nareas where native peat and silt are absent, the potentiometric surface in the Upper Glacial\nAquifer was observed to be relatively low, below elevation 2.0 in some monitoring wells. The\npotentiometric surface in the Upper Glacial Aquifer observed along the remainder of the canal\nwas generally observed to be between 2.0 and 2.5 NAVD.\nHydraulic conductivity values were assigned based on the presence or absence of silt and peat\nbelow the soft sediments, and indications of upwelling based on potentiometric heads in\nmonitoring wells adjacent to the canal. The following sediment hydraulic conductivities were\nassigned in the model:\nMarsh deposits present, no evidence of local upwelling: 0.01 – 0.1 ft/d\nMarsh deposits present, evidence of local upwelling: 0.5 ft/d\nNo marsh deposits present: 4 – 40 ft/d\nThe above values are typical for fine-grained soil, but are higher than those used for marsh\ndeposits in the model. Channeling may occur on a smaller scale through low-permeability silt\nand peat due to upward hydraulic pressure and erosion as a result of long-term upward\ndischarge.\n2.5.3 Upper Glacial Aquifer\nThe Upper Glacial Aquifer is the predominant geologic unit through which groundwater flows\nwithin the model. In the model, all groundwater flow toward the canal passes at some point\nthrough the Upper Glacial Aquifer, except for shallow recharge above the marsh deposits that\nmay discharge to the canal laterally through bulkheads. Within the model area, the Upper\nGlacial Aquifer is predominantly comprised of sandy glacial outwash occasionally containing\nsilty sand or interbedded with clayey till, but also contains two subunits containing\npredominantly till. Cartwright (2002) reports that the Upper Glacial Aquifer has a relatively\n13\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nhigh but locally variable permeability, and that the aquifer is generally unconfined but is\nconfined locally by layers of silt and clay within moraine deposits. The Site is located at the\nwestern terminus of the east-west trending Ronkonkoma-Harbor Hill terminal moraine.\nThe Upper Glacial Aquifer is modeled primarily as a zone of uniform hydraulic conductivity\nwhere the aquifer is predominantly glacial outwash sand (40 ft/day horizontal and 4 ft/day\nvertical). Fetter (1994) reports a hydraulic conductivity range of approximately 3 to 300\nft./day for glacial outwash. The order of magnitude of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in\nthe model (40 ft/day) is in the approximate middle of the order of magnitude range reported by\nAnderson (1992) for clean sand, and at the high end of the reported range for silty sand. The\nhydraulic conductivity used for the Upper Glacial Aquifer is indicative of a productive aquifer\nand is consistent with its use historically as a water supply source. Wells in the area of the Site\nhave been reported to yield between 60 and 300 gallons per minute (NYSDEC, 1937;\nNYSDEC, 1944). The maximum historic groundwater withdrawal rate reported for Kings\nCounty was 33 million gallons per day in 1910, at a time when the Upper Glacial Aquifer was\nthe predominant source aquifer (Cartwright, 2002).\nExtensive areas of till within the Upper Glacial Aquifer, referred to herein as till subunits, were\nmodeled as zones of lower hydraulic conductivities (1 to 5 ft/day horizontal and 0.05 to 0.1\nft/day vertical). The till subunits (north and south subunits, Fig 2-17) are located at the base of\nthe Prospect Hill moraine, and extends southeast of the canal. Thick till deposits were not\nobserved at some shallow locations adjacent to the canal, between the east and west zones, and\nmay represent a scour zone ancestral to the Gowanus Canal. As a result, a gap in the till unit is\napparent in model Layer 4 as shown in Figure 2-17, and the till unit remains continuous in\nLayer 5 as shown in Figure 2-18. The area between the two till subunits is comprised of\ninterbedded sand and till similar to other locations within the aquifer.\nLocal variations in hydraulic conductivity within the Upper Glacial Aquifer may be caused by\ndiscontinuous silt/clay lenses. A 5:1 vertical anisotropy ratio was used to represent\ninterbedded silt and clay within the sand unit, which would inhibit vertical groundwater flow.\nIt is assumed that till lenses are uniformly distributed in the aquifer such that at the scale of the\nmodel, bulk horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values for the upper glacial aquifer\nrepresent the combined effect of the outwash and till.\n2.5.4 Gardiners Clay\nThe Gardiners Clay is a major confining unit in the regional aquifer system, with hydraulic\nconductivities significantly lower than the adjoining sand and gravel units. The clay is a\nlagoonal marine deposit and consists of greenish-gray clay and silt with inter-bedded sand and\nsea shells. The Gardiners Clay has been observed to be comprised of silty sand at some\nlocations near the fringes of the formation. The clay is reported to range in thickness from\n14\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nabsent in northern Kings County to upwards of 100 feet to areas to the southeast and east of the\nSite (Cartwright, 2002).\nThe Gardiners Clay is present in the eastern two-thirds of the model area, and pinches out on\nthe western edge where the bedrock surface approaches the relatively flat Gardiners Clay unit.\nThe extent of the Gardiners Clay within the model was determined based on the approximate\nregional extent reported by USGS (2007) and soil boring logs from the Site and from USGS\nrecords. The Gardiners Clay was observed in the southern area of the canal (Site boring\nGCMW-40D2) as a 9.5-foot-thick layer of gray fine sand mixed with clay approximately 140\nfeet below ground surface. In the central area of the canal (Citizens Former MGP Boring\nCGMW-07D), the Gardiners Clay was observed as a 3.5-foot-thick layer of gray, very dense\nclay with shells, at approximately 130 feet below ground surface. Beneath the Fulton Works\nFormer MGP site, the Gardiners Clay was apparent as silty sand with sea shells. The\nGardiners Clay was found to be absent in some areas of the Citizens Former MGP site.\nThe Gardiners Clay is modeled in Layer 7. Layer 8 contains a thin line of Gardiners Clay to\nrepresent contact with bedrock at the base of the numerical model (Fig. 2-20). Discharge zones\nfor the Jameco Gravel to the Upper Glacial Aquifer are present in Layer 8 where the Gardiners\nClay is absent.\nThe Gardiners Clay was assigned a hydraulic conductivity of 0.008 ft/day, consistent with\npublished literature, where the clay was reported by Franke and Cohen (1972) to have vertical\nhydraulic conductivity of about 0.001 ft/day. Sand zones at the fringes were assigned a vertical\nhydraulic conductivity of 0.2 ft/day.\nNorth of the canal area, the Gardiners clay contacts bedrock, thus confining the underlying\nJameco Gravel laterally. West and south of the canal area, no contact between the Gardiners\nClay and bedrock was apparent based on available boring logs, suggesting no lateral\nconfinement of the Jameco Gravel. Therefore, in the approximate southern half of the model,\nthe Gardiners clay does not contact bedrock, forming a lateral discharge zone for the Jameco\nGravel to the Upper Glacial Aquifer, as described in Section 2.5.5.\n2.5.5 Jameco Gravel\nThe Jameco Gravel is described as a Pleistocene-era channel fill deposit associated with the\nancestral Hudson River channel scour of southern Kings and Queens Counties (Soren, 1978;\nEPA, 2010b). The unit consists of dark coarse sand and gravel with cobbles and boulders and\nranges in thickness from absent at some locations to approximately 200 feet thick in Queens\nCounty (Cartwright, 2002). The Jameco Gravel in the model has a horizontal hydraulic\nconductivity of 300 ft/day, consistent with published literature, where the Gardiners Jameco\nGravel was reported by Soren (1978) to have vertical hydraulic conductivity of in exceedance\nof 270 ft/day. The approximate elevation of the surface of the Jameco Gravel ranges between\n15\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n–100 feet NGVD and –150 feet NGVD beneath the Site and vicinity and slopes toward the\nsoutheast (Buxton, Soren, Posner and Shernoff, 1981).\nThe extent of the Jameco Gravel is similar to that of the Gardiners Clay (Cartwright, 2002). In\nthe model, the extent of the Jameco Gravel was assigned the same extent as the modeled extent\nof the overlying Gardiners Clay (Figs. 2-19 and 2-20). The Jameco Gravel is located between\nthe Gardiners Clay and bedrock. The top and bottom elevations of the Jameco Gravel were\nassigned as to be bottom of Gardiners clay and top of bedrock, based on available borings and\nmapped USGS elevations.\n16\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n3. Calibration\nThe calibrated model provides a calculated steady-state groundwater flow field representing\nmid-tide groundwater elevations. The objectives of model calibration consisted of matching\nmodel-calculated heads to observed heads at monitoring wells; qualitatively matching model-\ncalculated groundwater elevation contours to contours interpolated based on observed heads,\nand comparison of model-calculated base flow into the canal to a literature-reported value.\nThe model was calibrated by soil, sediment, and bulkhead hydraulic conductivities, and areal\nrecharge. The calibration data set is provided in Table 3. Observed and final (calibrated)\nwater level elevations for each calibration point are shown in Table 3. Calibration residuals\nplots for the entire model, the Upper Glacial Aquifer, and the Jameco Gravel are shown in\nFigures 3-1 through 3-3. Calibration data points are shown in Figures A-1 through A-4.\nModel-predicted and observed (interpolated) contours are shown in Figures A-5 through A-9,\nwhere it should be noted that the model calculates groundwater elevations within the entire\nactive model space, as compared to the observed contours which are only interpolated between\nobservation points. Potentiometric head contours are shown in cross-section in Figures 3-4 and\n3-5.\nThe calibration data set consists of tidally averaged static groundwater elevations for the Site\nand Former MGP gauging events, and single (non-tide specific) elevations for Parcel III of the\nCitizens Site and USGS monitoring wells. Groundwater elevations were measured at high tide\nin Site monitoring wells on July 26 and September 29, 1010; and at low tide on August 23 and\nOctober 22, 2010. Groundwater elevations were measured at both high and low tides on May\n5, 2003, April 4, 2005, and April 11, 2005 at Citizens Former MGP monitoring wells. Tidal\nmeasurements were averaged as described in Table 3, and the average measured elevation for\neach monitoring well were used as calibration data points. For Citizens Former MGP Parcel\nIII wells, readings from measurements taken October 24, 2008 were used. For wells in the\nUSGS monitoring well network, the approximate average of elevations reported through the\npast decade were used as calibration data points. Groundwater elevations over time as reported\nby USGS are shown in Appendix A, Figure A-1.\nThe time-averaged groundwater elevations shown in Table 3 represent regional conditions for\nmodel development and calibration. Tidal variation (difference between average measured\nhigh tide and average measured low tide elevations in each well) wells ranged from 4.43 to -\n3.5 feet, however, tide variation in most wells was less than 1 foot. The averaged high tide\nelevations were equal to or within 1 foot greater than the averaged low tide elevations at 108 of\n200 measurement locations. The averaged high tide elevations exceeded the averaged low tide\nelevations (positive tidal response) by greater than one foot at 17 of the 200 locations, most\nlocated near bulkheads. At 75 of the 200 locations, the averaged low tide groundwater\n17\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nelevations were equal to or greater than the averaged high tide elevations by as much as 3.5\nfeet, where the exceedances are attributed to seasonal fluctuations.\nShallow zone monitoring wells exhibiting a strong positive tidal response were located close to\nbulkheads. Monitoring wells screened in the Upper Glacial Aquifer exhibiting a strong tidal\nresponse were located in areas with slightly lower observed tidally-averaged groundwater\nelevations (below elevation 2.0 NAVD) within the Upper Glacial Aquifer. The relatively\nstrong tidal response and slightly lower potentiometric heads were interpreted to represent\nupward discharge zone areas, or areas where a relatively larger volume of water flows upward\nand discharges to the canal. Three such zones were apparent, and are described in Section 3.2.\nThe MODFLOW output calibration residuals plot for all data points in the model is presented\nin Figure 3-1. On the calibration plot it can be seen that high heads were predicted by the\nmodel where high heads where observed (at shallow depths within the mound on Parcel I) and\nlow heads were predicted where low heads were observed (in intermediate/deep groundwater\nand along the canal). The primary statistical goal for model calibration was to obtain a\nnormalized root mean square of the residuals of less than 10%. The normalized RMS for the\nmodel calibration is approximately 5.4%, which is well below this statistical objective, and\nthus shows that the model is well calibrated.\nCalibration residuals plots for the Upper Glacial and Jameco Gravel are shown in Figures 3-2\nand 3-3. The significant trends in the regional aquifers are being qualitatively met: upward\npreferential discharge zones with relatively low heads in the Upper Glacial Aquifer are\nrepresented by the lower observed and calculated heads (Fig. 3-2), while the remainder of the\npotentiometric surface within the Upper Glacial Aquifer on and near the Site is relatively flat,\nranging primarily between elevations 2 and 3 NAVD. Similarly, the calibration residuals plot\nfor the Jameco Gravel indicates that significant regional trends are quantitatively met in the\nmodel: groundwater elevations near discharge zones along the western fringe of the Gardiners\nClay are generally lowest. A water budget is presented in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the\npercent difference between calculated flow rates entering and leaving the model, for the\ncalibration run and three predictive runs, are below 0.1%, which is considered generally\nacceptable. The model was run with head change and residual criterion between numerical\niterations set to 0.01 feet.\nUSGS (1998) developed a regional model developed for assessing historic and current\ngroundwater resource use on Long Island. In the USGS model a base flow of groundwater to\nthe Gowanus Canal was estimated to be 1,122 GPM prior to industrial development, zero\nduring aquifer recovery in 1983 (one to two decades after cessation of pumping), and 134\nGPM as of 1991. The groundwater model described herein calculates a base flow to the canal\nof 675 GPM. The USGS model incorporates a coarser grid, where assumptions regarding the\nextent of the terminal moraine and Jameco Gravel are more generalized. Both of these model\nelements would affect estimates of net flow through the modeled systems.\n18\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n3.1 Shallow Zone\nShallow zone model-calculated and observed (interpolated) contours are shown for the\nnorthern, central, and southern portions of the canal in Figures A-6 through A-8. Shallow\ngroundwater elevations generally range from elevation 1 to 8 NAVD on properties adjacent to\nthe canal. Calculated groundwater elevations were primarily affected by the hydraulic\nconductivity of fill material and sediments. Baseline hydraulic conductivities of 10 ft/day and\n0.1 ft/day were used for shallow zone soil and bulkhead permeability, at the start of model\ncalibration. The hydraulic conductivity values were varied locally to match observed\nconditions. A relatively high fill hydraulic conductivity value (35 ft/day) was assigned to areas\nwhere the water table was relatively flat. Relatively low (0.1 to 0.5 ft/day) hydraulic\nconductivities were assigned where steeper gradients were observed or where the groundwater\ntable was relatively high. The baseline bulkhead hydraulic conductivity was increased in areas\nwhere observed groundwater elevations were relatively low (generally less than elevation 2\nNAVD), or where relatively high positive tidal response was observed. Areal recharge was\nalso adjusted as part of calibration refinement, to the values shown in Figure 2-10.\nAs shown in Figure A-6 through A-8, model-calculated groundwater elevations generally\napproximate the tidally-averaged observed elevations. At the former MGP sites, where there\nare a greater density of data, groundwater flow trends generally approximate observed flow\ndirections and gradients. Further from the canal (outside the approximate extent of the marsh\ndeposits), the water table is considered part of the Upper Glacial Aquifer for calibration\npurposes and is described in Section 3.2. Adjacent to the canal, shallow groundwater is\nmounded above the marsh deposit aquitard (where present) to elevations generally ranging\nfrom 1 to 4 NAVD. Groundwater preferentially flows toward the canal, with a relatively minor\ncomponent of flow into the marsh deposits. At the Citizens Former MGP site, the water table\nmounds to approximately elevation 10. The mound is in the location of former gas holders and\nburied structures. Along the western extent of the mound, the shallow contours indicate that\ngroundwater flows westerly, away from the canal. Once the mounded groundwater passes the\nwestern extent of the aquitard, it enters the Upper Glacial Aquifer and becomes part of the\nregional flow discharging to the canal further downstream from the Citizens MGP Former site.\n3.2 Upper Glacial Aquifer\nModel-calculated and observed (interpolated) contours are shown for the Upper Glacial\nAquifer on Figure A-8. Groundwater elevations generally range from elevation 2 to 3 at the\nSite, and up to elevation 10 north of the Site. Calculated groundwater elevations in the Upper\nGlacial layers were affected by the hydraulic conductivity of formation, sediment conductivity,\nand areal recharge. A baseline hydraulic conductivity of 40 ft/day was used for the Upper\nGlacial Aquifer permeability, at the start of model calibration, and was varied in specific\nlocations as described below.\n19\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nRelatively high recharge over Prospect Park, and relatively low-permeability till west of\nProspect Park (north till subunit, Fig. 2-17) contribute to the higher potentiometric surface in\nthe eastern portion of the model. The potentiometric surface in the Upper Glacial Aquifer\nalong the canal is relatively flat (generally between 2 and 3 NAVD) along the length of the\ncanal, with three localized areas of lower potentiometric head (below 2 NAVD; Fig. A-8). The\ntill subunits described in Section 2.5.3 were assigned lower hydraulic conductivity values. The\npresence of the south till subunit (Fig. 2-17) results in a slight increase in potentiometric heads\nnear the lower third of the canal, while the absence of marsh deposits at the northern end of the\ncanal contributes to a slight lowering of the potentiometric surface at the northern end of the\ncanal. A relatively high fill hydraulic conductivity value (35 ft/day) was assigned to areas\nwhere the water table was relatively flat. Relatively low (0.1 to 0.5 ft/day) hydraulic\nconductivities were assigned where steeper gradients were observed or where the groundwater\ntable was relatively high. The baseline bulkhead hydraulic conductivity was increased in areas\nwhere observed groundwater elevations were relatively low (generally less than elevation 2\nNAVD), or where relatively high positive tidal response was observed. Localized zones of\nvarying conductivity were assigned where potentiometric heads indicate the presence of\nincreased or reduced upwelling (Fig. 2-17).\nModel-calculated contours are compared with contours reported by Buxton and Shernoff\n(1997) for groundwater head elevations within the Upper Glacial Aquifer on Fig. A-8.\nGroundwater flow is shown to flow outward (westerly) from the eastern divide and southerly\nfrom areas of downtown Brooklyn and Cobble Hill, converging to the canal, Gowanus Bay,\nand the East River. The three upwelling zones in the northern, central, and southern portions\nare indicated by the elevation 2 contours. An offset between the observed and calculated\ncontours for the central upwelling area is attributed to localized zones of channeling. The\nregional contour reported by Buxton and Shernoff representing elevation 5 NAVD is largely\ninferred, and no data points support the exact location of the reported contour. The model-\ncalculated contours are considered validated and consistent with Buxton and Shernoff.\n3.3 Jameco Gravel\nModel-calculated and observed (interpolated) contours are shown for the Jameco Gravel on\nFigure A-9. Groundwater potentiometric heads in the Jameco Gravel range from elevations 5\nand 8 NAVD as defined by the CHBs described in Section 2.4.1. Calculated groundwater\nelevations in the Jameco Gravel were affected by the presence and location of zones of\nhydraulic communication between the Jameco Gravel and Upper Glacial Aquifer. As can be\nseen in Figure A-9, a major component of groundwater flow in the modeled Jameco Gravel is\nwesterly, towards discharge zones and preferential flow paths through relatively thin deposits\nof the Gardiners Clay where the clay pinches out at its western limit. At the western model\nboundary, groundwater flow becomes more southerly, consistent with regional flow depicted in\nFigure 2-3. Comparison of model-predicted contours in Figures A-9 and A-10 shows that\npotentiometric heads within the Jameco Gravel (model layer 7) are higher than those shown in\n20\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nFigure A-9 for the Upper Glacial Aquifer (layer 4), indicating a general upward vertical head\npotential consistent with observed heads.\n3.4 Sediments/Marsh Deposits\nCanal sediment hydraulic conductivity, including underlying native marsh deposits (where\npresent), primarily affects upward flow from the underlying Upper Glacial Aquifer. Sediment\nhydraulic conductivities in the model (layer 3, Fig. 2-16) represent a weighted average of soft\nsediments and native marsh deposits. A baseline hydraulic conductivity of 0.5 ft/day (vertical)\nwas used for the sediment permeability, at the start of model calibration. Four additional\nconductivity zones were created, to represent locations where marsh deposits are absent\nbeneath the canal, and areas where sediment conductivity appears to be lower, based on\nrelatively higher potentiometric heads in nearby wells screened in the Upper Glacial Aquifer.\nAlong a portion of the canal adjacent to the Citizens Former MGP site, the canal is actively\nused for barge docking. Gravel with little to no soft sediment, and no marsh deposits are\npresent. In the barge docking area, the same conductivity value used for the Upper Glacial\nSand was used in layer 3 to represent a sediment layer with little to no resistance to upward\nvertical flow from the aquifer.\nMarsh deposits in the model primarily affect the extent and degree of water table mounding or\nperching in overlying fill. A baseline vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.5 ft/day was used for\nthe sediment permeability, at the start of model calibration. Three minor areas of varying\nmarsh deposit conductivity were defined, to refine calibration at individual shallow\ngroundwater data points indicating that marsh deposit conductivities may be lower or higher.\n21\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n4. Sensitivity Analysis\nAn analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivities and recharge\nrates on model calibration. These parameters would have the greatest effect on modeled\ngroundwater flow at the Site. The analysis was performed by comparing the change in\ncalibration residuals with changes in hydraulic conductivity and recharge. Calibration error, as\nmeasured by the normalized root mean square (NRMS) of the calibration residuals (calculated\nminus observed heads) for the sensitivity runs are shown in Figures 4-1 through 4-3. The\nNRMS is a measure of the correlation between observed and predicted heads. In general, the\nNRMS varies as the parameters change, and the lowest NRMS value corresponds to the most\naccurate parameter value for the model. Therefore, as the parameter is varied further from its\nmost accurate value, the NMRS increases, and the plot of NRMS vs. parameter value would be\na curve where the low point corresponds to the value most appropriate for use in the system\nmodeled. However, if the calibrated model is not sensitive to a parameter, the NMRS may not\nchange, and a sensitivity analysis for the subject parameter would be recommended for the\npredictive model.\nHydraulic conductivity for key strata in the model (fill, marsh deposits, sediments, and glacial\nsand, and the till subunits) were increased and decreased to values within ranges reasonable for\nthe soil type. Calibration was most sensitive to variation in sediment and glacial sand\nconductivity, because changes in these units affect a large number of data points.\nThe recharge rate for each recharge zone in the model was varied over a range of several\ninches, depending on effect. The model was roughly equally sensitive to changes in the\ncommercial/industrial, residential, and undeveloped areas. The NRMS was not significantly\naffected by changes in the recharge value used for parks; however, the model was qualitatively\naffected in the eastern portion of the model where no data points exist. The water table\nelevation along the eastern site boundary was sensitive to recharge applied to Prospect Park,\nand a recharge value of 10 in./year was selected because it resulted in the approximate water\ntable elevation reported by USGS in the area. Based on the quantitative sensitivity analysis\nresults shown on Figures 4-1 through 4-3, and qualitative model calibration where no data\npoints exist, the most accurate input parameter values were used in the model.\n22\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n5. Validation\nConfidence that a model calibration is uniquely correct can be improved (although never fully\nachieved) if the model can be shown to adequately predict water levels and other calibration\ntargets, such as groundwater discharge rates, for a wholly different set of hydrogeologic\nstresses than the steady-state conditions to which the model has been initially calibrated.\nExamples of a different set of hydrogeologic stresses include a major aquifer test that stresses a\nsignificant portion of the model or a period of drought. This process is often referred to as\n“verification” or “validation.”. Toward this end, an analysis was performed to assess that the\nmodel properly calculates past observed changes in groundwater elevations due to historic\nevents. Available data indicate that periods of historic pumping and lower precipitation\nresulted in lower potentiometric surfaces within the Upper Glacial Aquifer.\n5.1 Water Supply Pumping\nThe public water supply is currently provided to the Site and surrounding area by the New\nYork City Water Department. The water supply comes from a series of aqueducts from a\nwatershed located 125 miles north of New York City.\nHistoric pumping for previous water supply purposes resulted in significant drawdown of the\nregional aquifer system, which has recovered since pumping ceased between the 1960s and\n1970 (Cartwright, 2002). The water table was reported to have been decreased to as low as\nelevation -35 in some areas, or about 37 feet below its current potentiometric surface. The\nmodel was used to assess whether pumping from known wells within the model at their\nreported yield would produce drawdowns equal to or less than those reported by Cartwright\n(2002) for the year 1951. Although not a perfect simulation since a majority of pumping\noccurred outside the model boundary a model-calculated drawdown with partial pumping that\nis less than the observed drawdown under full pumping conditions represents a validation of\nthe model’s predictive abilities.\nSeveral pumping wells were located within the model limits and have been documented by the\nUSGS (Figure 5-1). Pumping from a subset of these wells at their reported yield (14 wells for\na total of 3,656 GPM (5 Mgal/day)) was modeled at steady-state to assess whether the model-\npredicted drawdown is within range of reported historic drawdowns. Wells close to the model\nlimits were not included in the validation to avoid boundary effects. The model calculated\ndrawdowns to elevation -5 within the immediate vicinity of the wells, and a larger zone of 2 to\n4-foot drawdowns extending approximately one-half mile from the wells (Fig. A-11).\nHistorically-reported drawdowns were deeper and widespread in these areas (elevation -15 to -\n25 NAVD). The model-predicted drawdown under partial pumping conditions was less than\n23\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nthe observed drawdown under full pumping conditions. The comparatively lower drawdown\ncalculated by the model represents a validation of the model’s predictive abilities.\n5.2 Reduced Precipitation\nHistorical data indicate that an extended period of reduced groundwater recharge occurred\nbetween approximately 1999 and 2003. USGS long-term monitoring data indicate a 1.5 to 2-\nfoot decrease in groundwater elevations within the Upper Glacial Aquifer in several\nobservation wells during this period (Fig. A-12). Meteorological data suggests that an\nextended period of rainfall generally below the annual average, a reduction in rainfall events\nexceeding 0.1-inches (0.1-Years), and below-average snowfall, are contributing factors\n(Fig. 5-2). Observed drawdowns, based on an estimation of an annual average elevation over\nthe affected period shown for area wells in Figure A-1, are shown in Figure A-11. No spatial\nvariation in trends was apparent that would suggest an artificial localized source of drawdown.\nFrom Figure 5-2, an extended approximate 10% decrease in days with rainfall exceeding 0.1-\ninches is apparent, and a 10 to 30% decrease in snowfall is apparent. We assumed that the\naquifer was at steady state during the period of reduced precipitation. Model-calculated\ndrawdown contours with a 20% reduction in annual recharge are shown for the Upper Glacial\nAquifer (model layer 4) on Figure A-12. The drawdown contour values are relative to the\nsteady-state potentiometric surface for layer 4 in the calibrated model. The model predicted\ndrawdown ranges of between 0.2 and 1.8 feet, which is consistent with the observed values.\nThe pattern of greater drawdown within eastern portions of the model was similar to the\nobserved pattern of drawdown. The similarity between model-predicted and observed\ndrawdown associated with reduced recharge is considered a validation of the model’s\npredictive abilities.\n24\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\n6. Findings and Recommendations\n6.1 Findings\nA groundwater flow simulation model was constructed to quantify the regional aquifer system\ncontributing to the Gowanus Canal. Findings presented in this section consist of model-\ncalculated estimates of base flow from the aquifer system to the canal, and delineation of the\nestimated area of groundwater contribution to the canal.\n6.1.1 Base Flow Estimate\nBase flow estimates were calculated to support human health and ecological risk assessments\nassociated with the canal and adjacent upland sites, to provide input data for hydrodynamic\nanalysis of flow within the canal, and for use in evaluating potential remedial alternatives for\nthe Site.\nBase flow estimates were calculated using the Zone Budget interface of Visual MODFLOW.\nFor the purpose of estimating base flow, the canal was divided in to six segments. For each\nsegment, zone budget cells were assigned within, alongside, and beneath the canal, to quantify\nboth horizontal contribution through bulkheads, and vertical contribution from the regional\naquifer. The estimated base flow is presented in Figure 6-1.\n6.1.2 Groundwater Contribution Area\nThe zone of contribution of groundwater to the Gowanus Canal was estimated for purposes of\nidentifying resources that may be affected by remedial alternatives or that may affect the\npotential alternatives. The zone of contribution was estimated using particle flow paths\ncalculated by MODFLOW. The contribution area for the Upper Glacial Aquifer is estimated to\nbe 2.8 square miles as shown in Figure 6-2. The area of shallow zone contribution would be\nsimilar, because shallow zone and the Upper Glacial Aquifer water table surface are identical\noutside the former marsh deposit area, as described in Section 3.1.\n6.2 Recommendations\nThe groundwater model is provided for use in evaluation of potential remedial alternatives\nwithin the canal and abutting upland sites. The groundwater model as described herein is a\nrepresentation of regional flow. The model was calibrated to match groundwater elevations at\nlocations of existing wells, and to match published regional groundwater flow patterns. The\nmodel has been validated and is generally suitable for use in evaluating interactions of\nremedial components on a comparative and holistic basis. At former MGP locations with a\n25\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\ngreater density of calibration data, the model may be used for more detailed remedial design\nevaluations. For potential remedial scenarios at specific properties where data are sparse,\nadditional detail and a refinement of calibration in the area of concern may be appropriate to\nunderstand and adequately model site-specific conditions.\nPotential remedies that may be modeled are described below, followed by recommendations\nfor interpretation of results:\n Dredging: Dredging programs that involve removal of native silt and peat deposits may\nalter upward flow patterns to the canal and therefore be increasing hydraulic\ncommunication between the canal and the Upper Glacial Aquifer. The impacts of\npotential dredging projects may be modeled by increasing the hydraulic conductivity of\nthe sediment layer in the proposed dredging areas.\n Sediment Capping or In-Situ Stabilization/Solidification: Sediment capping using\nimpervious or low-permeability material, or in-situ stabilization/solidification resulting\nin a lower sediment hydraulic conductivity than the existing sediments and underlying\nmarsh deposits, may cut off or deflect upward flow of groundwater to the canal. The\nimpacts of sediment capping or in-situ stabilization/solidification may be modeled by\ndecreasing the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment layer in proposed capping areas.\n Bulkhead Improvements/Cutoff Walls: Reconstruction of bulkheads or installation of\ngroundwater or Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) cutoffs may be modeled by\nreducing the hydraulic conductivity of the wall boundary in the affected area. The\neffect of cutoff walls of varying depths and types may be modeled. The depth of the\ncutoff wall should be extended to the appropriate layer in the model.\n Remedial Excavation: Soil excavation and backfill with clean material may be\nmodeled by changing the hydraulic conductivity within the excavation volume to a\nvalue representative of the backfill material. Excavation dewatering rates may be\nmodeled using drain cells or pumping wells; likewise, excavation support may be\nmodeled as wall boundaries.\n Pavement Caps or Impervious Liners: Capping or lining of an upland site may be\nmodeled as areas of reduced areal recharge.\n Groundwater Extraction: Groundwater extraction systems may be modeled as pumping\nwells.\n Relief Drains: Relief drains are generally an ancillary component to remedial systems.\nRelief drains may be modeled as drain cells, or as cells of specified hydraulic\nconductivities connected to a head boundary or drain representing an outlet, filter\nmedia, or pump chamber.\n26\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nThe model indicates that the canal is a significant discharge zone of groundwater from the\nregional aquifer. Changes in bulkhead or sediment hydraulic conductivity would affect\ngroundwater flow directions and head elevations. Modeling should be performed at a\nminimum to quantify the potential for basement and utility flooding, and for the migration of\ndissolved contaminants to previously unimpacted areas. The effects of alternative remedial\nsystems on groundwater hydraulics should be evaluated; including:\n Alteration of groundwater flow direction should be analyzed using particle flow paths\nand interpretation of model-calculated groundwater contours.\n Water table mounding should be analyzed by interpretation of model-calculated\ngroundwater elevation contours, and comparison of predicted groundwater elevation\ncontours to basement and utility elevations.\n The effect of remedial systems on base flow to the canal should be quantified using\nparticle flow paths and zone budget.\n The effect of remedial systems on the quantity of groundwater flow entering or exiting\nspecific properties or areas of concern quantified using particle flow paths and zone\nbudget.\n The potential for NAPL migration should be assessed in part by mapping groundwater\nvelocities. NAPL may be mobilized by shear or by significant changes in groundwater\nflow direction, and lower-viscosity NAPL would have a greater potential to be\nmobilized by changes in groundwater flow patterns. DNAPL (dense NAPL; or NAPL\nwith a density greater than water) generally flows under its own gradient along\nconfining units, and the use of calculated velocities to estimate the potential for\nDNAPL migration should be evaluated in consideration of the stability of the subject\nDNAPL pool.\n The capture zone for extraction wells and funnel systems may be estimated using\nparticle flow paths and model-calculated drawdown contours.\nThe model presented in this report quantifies flow under steady-state conditions. Predictions\nfor potential remedial systems under steady-state are intended to represent the long-term\nhydraulic effects of the systems being modeled. Transient analyses also may be performed to\nassess the hydraulic effects of short-term changes in boundary conditions (like doing remedial\nconstruction) or temporally varying remedial systems such as cyclical pumping. Potential\nclimatic effects on recharge and mean sea level may be evaluated by adjusting the appropriate\nboundary conditions. Sensitivity analyses are recommended to assess whether predicted\nresults (with proposed remedial components in place in the model) change when model inputs\n(soil properties or boundary conditions) are varied within reasonable ranges. Safety factors\nshould be incorporated into the design if predicted hydraulic effects could potentially exceed\ndesign tolerances. Monitoring programs should be implemented after remedial construction to\nconfirm that water level elevations are within predicted ranges.\n27\nGROUNDWATER MODEL REPORT\nNATIONAL GRID\nGOWANUS CANAL SUPERFUND SITE\nDECEMBER 2011\nReferences\nAnderson, 1992.

No. None of this is safe. Building upon toxic wasteland by cutting corners will always cover up that it is toxic wasteland. Stop lying to people. Poonami! Black mayonnaise, YUM I live in Gowanus. It's just a lot of high priced rentals being built and the clean up of the Gowanus  Canal is very slow, as usual. Another project for implants and the top 1%.

After that throw in gallons of chlorine So the super fund was just a waste of taxpayer money then? The Gowanus Canal and the Newtown Creek are toxic nightmares. The person who had a big hand in cleaning up New Yorks waterways died in a plane crash in 1999. JFK Jr So this still needs to be cleaned up Does this canal flood Didn’t know anything about this canal Why is the Gowanus Canal Conservancy not mentioned? Right off the bat you start with mistruths. Welcome to social media. The harmful part is that millions upon millions of people believe everything they read. not connected to the hudson prospect hieghts I live in Evansville, Indiana and we have our own version of Gowanus Canal, it's called Pigeon Creek 👍👍 Hear me out. What if they built a 8, maybe 10 inch pipe under Degraw St. from the port right by where 478 crosses under the water, straight up to where Degraw dead ends at the canal, then bust a left to go up to the very tippy top of the canal. Then put a pump on the end that's out in the bay and run it when tides are going out. Pump fresh ish water from the bay to the top of the canal. It'll eventually flush it out and supply a constant flow of fresher water... It wouldn't be quick. You don't wanna shock the rest of the bay with the pollution. Maybe wait until the first big rainstorm after construction to turn the pumps on for the first flush. Work WITH the bay and the tides and rain and whatever other factors and slowly start flushing it... I think it could work... You'd also still have to fix the things that are still polluting the water... But it's doable... My degen brain read cowanus and clicked 😅 How about a nice swim 🤔🤔🤔…..😱🥴‼️ I had google what super fun site was . I turned on  subtitles they said whay heard aswell😂 turns out epa superfund site . Yet we sent millions.  If not billions   of dollars overseas . My brother has been working there for the past 2 years. It's the only Superfund job going on in the country. But yes they are all working pretty much round the clock 7 days a week. They actually dug almost 300 feet down into the soil & at times hitting bedrock & still coming up with chemicals & toxins from close to 200 years ago. It's crazy how that stuff never disappears. But when that job is all complete the area & the canal will be clean enough to go kayaking & MAYBE even swimming. They are installing underground 12million gallon storage & overflow tanks, filtration systems which will clean up the canal & also stop the flooding problems in the area when it rains hard & also a beautiful park. It's gonna be great for the neighborhood. But like everything, some people always have to pay a price. And knock on wood it's not my brother or any other worker there in their futures breathing & being exposed to all that crap every day. ew Good video. Keep it up. One small thing at 3:21, I think the Dutch always refer to the Netherlands as the fatherland or father country (vaderland). I could be mistaken though. Thanks! This place is worse than love canal 18:10 Yeah, Sam should go for a swim there! Marge Simpson served Mr. Burns a three eyed fish in 1990 I heard a story of a kid who fell in the canal once and had to take a disinfecting shower lol so sad that we have money to send to other countries but not to fix our own. History is a complete joke. We built the pyramids with Donkeys and copper chisels 😂 Since the day the car was invented was the day that the major pollution in the United States started never Mind what happened in other countries Without pollution we would not be where we are today which is a sad fact You heard what he said city government Aren't we just happy with city governments Corruption at its finest all the way to the White House We already know the answer one thing and 1 thing only grieved from corporate enerplease don't you just love it they can pollute get no fines use your old paper out your car window you're likely to get a ticket I watched this video because of the Majority Report. It smells awful. It’s has a color that changes. No animals excepts a few birds. I’m sure no aquatic life is in it. It smells awful. It’s has a color that changes. No animals excepts a few birds. I’m sure no aquatic life is in it. Specifically, what progress is being made? What is the status of the Superfund cleanup project? Left is best. Reconstruction 🤔 Even today in 2025 there are signs saying not to come into contact with thr water The problem with this canal is that it is stagnant. There is no inflow of fresh water to furnish oxygen and flush out the wastes and decay. It is basically a lagoon.\nOne thing that could down is to divert run-off rainwater from the streets and buildings. I designed several bulkheads along the banks of the canal from the early 1980's tp late 1990's. It was just putrid. When the oil barges would go through,  they would stir up the bottom muck. The stench was overpowering. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE CHICAGO RIVER STORY! \nIT TOO WAS BEING USED AS AN INDUSTRIAL SEWER, AND POLLUTED THE FRESH WATER REMOVED FROM LAKE MICHIGAN FOR CHICAGO DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY!\nTHIS WAS SOLVED BY REVERSING THE FLOW, AND DIVERTING THE DIRTY WATER TO THE ILLINOIS RIVER, TO DUMP IT INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER!!\nGRAFTON ILLINOIS IS WHERE THE ILLINOIS RIVER ENTERS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER! Prospect heights Great stuff A monument to nothing? You mean ny who is a ridiculous shell of itself because of not in my backyard and so on what do you think would happen from fishing to so to so on Walabout creek also the name came from some old man telling his donkey to go on ass Can’t eat itvthough I love fishing down there with my bamboo poles Three-eyed catfish??\nSIMPSONS DID IT! I can't believe that nothing has been done to address this hazardously contaminated water way in all the decades it's been this way! How TF could the shithole that is New York be considered or called America's heartland? Blasphemy! If you throw a stick in the gowanus canal, it doesn't float. It bends 18:19 It's actually \"Broadcasting live STEPS from the industrially RAVAGED Gowanus Canal in the heartland of America, Downtown Brooklyn, USA.\" Can you do the canals of Lowell MA next? I know those aren't crab pot markers at 0:58.....I'll have a heart attack if they are. *How very sad for our planet* 🌎 When my kids were young in the 90's I had a small wooden boat that I kept out at Dead Horse Bay, but I'd sail it to the canal, then motor all the way up to Union Street or Caroll street and moor it. We'd get in and out by climbing up the sides of the bridges. Their mother lived just up on President street, and I across fourth avenue, on Sackett. A lot of the waterfront was still almost lawless then. Nobody stopped you, or demanded permits or anything like that. People would live all Summer on the beaches out near Jamaica bay, unbothered by the law.  Even well into the 2000's we'd cart a big expedition kayak I had down there and paddle out to the bay. It was a magic time, because the water was no longer as hideously foul as it had been, but it was before the 1% bought it all for development. We could even get in and out of the boat directly onto Second Street, which was at the time just a bleak dead end where the working girls would bring their customers, and people would burn cars for the insurance money.  The canal was never naturally so foul--it became so because of the exit tunnel was broken for so many years. When Jesus walked on the water it was no trick. He just walked on the Gowanus. It was so filthy his toes never touched water. It has been like this for 100+ years and it still has not been cleaned!😂😂😂😂😂 1010 News would always mention the Gowanus in its traffic report.  \n\nEveryone knew not to jump in the canal.   \n\nThe reason crime is high in nyc is because all those criminals fell in the canal.  You can look it up. Stop taking away our industrial wastelands and putting condos on top. Any place that looks “rundown” or “unsafe” is where art is thriving. Bulldozing the area and then building condos only widens the wealth disparity gap and removes culture. Hey but lets waste hundred of billions of dollars to give away all over the world... Government is soooo great... NOT Big striped bass lurk this canal 100thousnand is nothin The ice cream shop near the canal has a chocolate Ice cream called \" It came from the Gowanus canal\" Yes, but the important question is , Is it rising? I'll bet the answer is No..... My brother who lives on Long Island wears a Gowanus Yacht Club t-shirt. How is a prestigious yacht club able to flourish if the water is so stinky? From what i heard the water was red before the city dyed it green Someone should consider putting a Whole Foods here; as performance art. How VILE!!\nIt's a TOXIC WASTE DUMP!\nNo SANE HUMAN would live anywhere near there; and they are building apartment buildings?? No doubt REALLY EXPENSIVE!! So, one will pay out the arse to BE POISONED, when buying/living in one of these apartments. \nThis toxic waste is a crime against humanity! All of these businesses, along the canal/who've contributed to this, should be made to pay for the clean up! As far back as one could go (former business owners)......MAKE THEM PAY!\nThis toxic waste is due to one thing....GREED!! \n\nYes....America = FREEDOM. But one must understand what COMES with Freedom.....RESPONSIBILITY! I'm all for making $$; but if you cannot do it without turning your surroundings into a TOILET/TOXIC WASTE DUMP......then, NO!......you do NOT 'have the Right to.....'!! So I'm the 3rd generation in my family to become a dock builder / timberman local 1556 NYC , our job has many different jobs that are all specialized trades , exa. Pile driving, underwater welding and construction , divers tender ,  bridges and tunnels , and much much more.  We have been on every bridge , tunnel , and every single body of water whether stagnant or moving , \nEvery foundation in Manhattan has to be reinforced and is under the water table so we also do foundations.  \nEver wonder how bridges are built especially the support and the  foundation that's under the water ? , yup , that's us. I'ma go out on a limb here and say it's exactly because it was a vital water way that it ended up like this. I don't like them they stink...oh you said Gowanus. I have lived near the Gowanus Canal for the past 25 years.  This area has changed greatly.  Your video makes no mention of the massive cleanup of the canal over the past few years. Place with beautiful name\n👏 i lived in the neighborhood for years i was hoping to hear about the repair of the water intake pump and the pump breaking after a few years and what effect it had on canal, i remember schools testing shellfish oysters and mussels to see of it could live udder the carol street bridge The industrialy ravaged I worked near there and there was outside sitting were i had my lunch. In the summer what a stink and it had bubbles plopping  about. The industrially ravaged Gowanus canal in the heartland of America: downtown Brooklyn USA So where does the sewage go. I thought it was pumped out into the ocean. Clean up Chicago and Baltimore, huh? Well... The water won't fight back, maybe you should've started there to show yourself worthy. Preston and Childs featured the Gowanas canal in one of the Pendergast novels. The rich of NYC deserve no better than a super fund site beneath their condos. Sorry not sorry. Crazy SAI trails in those recent photos. No wonder it’s so polluted - it comes from the sky as well as the city… look up! Not \"Indians,\" but Native Americans! I can smell it from here! https://www.nyc.gov/content/getstuffdone/pages/gowanus-cleanup Developers have people drinking the coolaid. They’ve developed the hell out of that area.  They are building a mini city down there. Windows that can’t open in those high rise apt buildings.  I can only imagine the hard to detect toxic vapors wafting around in those buildings. \"Prosper Heights?\" I know this isn't a geography channel, but... Professor Socash I must have missed this one, glad I never lived in NYC, stay safe and be at peace... I got the not so pleasure of seeing it once or smelling it once , o got lost making my way out of it , this is before gps 😮😢 when u have to use road map atlas 😮😢 Let me guess - corporate interests have exceeded private industry's ability to compete and this canal was very important to those smaller private businesses which now cease to exist. With no interests located on the canal having the financial power to spark the government into action through bribes and corruption - money goes elsewhere. Am I close? It's hopeless, let's not kid ourselves. Majority Report says “industrially ravaged Gowanus Canal” Sooooooooooo government has been incompetent for multiple centuries, got it. All major cities wiped out industry The majority report are some of the most despicable liars in media today. They constantly fear monger their political opponents and have absolutely no qualms completely fabricating and intentionally twisting facts to serve their narrative. Power and control is their only ambition by any means necessary. They will never have good faith opposing arguments and are some of the most poshest elitists I’ve ever witnessed. It was sad how ingnorant, and even uncaring, our ancestors were about the environment. Please please please stop saying \"indians\" when referring to Native Americans PLEASE Skipper Matt, I'm finding the same amazement every single adventure you complete and translate into the most riveting videos. Your acumen with the kayak, canoes and urban exploring gets superb video presentation. The collage of water sights at the end, the closing segment with the young geese (A collection of geese on the water is commonly called a plump. I looked it up!) and the music begins to play....was delightful. In your many videos, sometimes far shots show you operate while the distant camera follows you is a Felix the Cat Bag o' Tricks item. For example in this Gowanus Canal episode, when you were all packed up climbing the ladder made it seem like you had a camera man covering your climb, but I figure you got something robotic going on.....and PLEASE, keep it your secret, your trade secret and just let me guess how you do it! I love the modern gear you employ young Man including the amazing kayak. As I traveled all the boroughs and Long Island and the Jersey side of the NY Metro region in my working years, I've seen many strange, scary and wonderful things. But never have I seen anyone climb out of any urban waterway with a huge boat backpack in tow and just pop up on the street ready to find a bodega and get a Coke! You're looking mighty fine with the new warm season upon us, a champion's look. Thank you and continue safe practice. 💯💫🍒🌎 35:24 did you ignore him saying you can't boat there? Today I went for a walk in the shittest area of my town, on purpose.  I am becoming like you lol. That grain depot looks like the building from Ninja Turtles back in the day. Where all those kids in the foot clan were skateboarding and smoking cigarettes underage. What a strange place. They asked about sharks as the Hudson has brown sharks. Not like Jaws, LOL. So love your videos! great video You know the pollution is bad if your kayak starts to dissolve! That scary looking gost  ship has been docked at that spot since I was a kid has a cougar on the exhaust funnel. I’m 52 years old and it’s been sitting there for at least 45 years. At one time they were painting it. Then they stopped. I would love to know the history of that ship. What a good video, I watch all your videos here in Brazil. Hats off to you! What courage! I was having a panic attack just to see you paddle beside that huge old ship. I have megalophobia, especially around big ships and warehouses. You are really crazy and I admire how long you can kayak. It must be exhausting. Thank you for giving us such insights and thank you for taking care of yourself Can't believe you're going into the Gowanus without a spacesuit. we used to swim there, I still can't understand why I have 3 eyes I was raised by my godparents in the Carroll Gardens Neighborhood of the New York City Borough of Brooklyn at 26A 1st Street 3rd Floor Apartment, in Brooklyn, New York 11231 from 1958 to 1982, , 2 Blocks Away from the Carroll Street Bridge Built in 1889 Over the Gowanus Canal Built in 1854 originally called the Gowanus Creek. Awhh Matt you make me smile & chuckle luv ❤ your video adventures! Thank you! Your kayaking reminds me of when we first paved roads for bicycle users. Then cars got adopted and the thoroughfares began catering to larger and faster cars. Today, car culture ruins so many cities that could be so much nicer if people just slowed down. Just look at the backlash from motorists about bike lanes stealing parking spots or other berating of \"15 minute cities\".\n\nIn a hundred years, all these beautiful waterways will be stocked with speed boats throwing wake constantly and yelling at kayaks and canoes to \"GET OUTTA THE WAY!\"\n\nI'm also reminded of Disney's Motor Mania from the 1950s! Even then we knew things were bad!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwPSIb3kt_4 Thank you for this amazing video. I think you might be the bravest person alive. those have to be the largest tug boats in the world At 20 minutes whats the name of that old ship??? Whats that huge building??? I'm guessing it would take away from the video but do you ever consider wearing a mask or cloth over your face or something to block any any water mist in the dirtier places? Folding portable boat?\nLink to buy one? New York is a disgusting democrat cesspool. If you're lucky you will get to see the trains. That they put on a special train barges to bring. Ing from Jersey to Brooklyn sunset parkk Bush terminal. How were the odors? 😂 how do you get the pollution off your kayak? Salute to great uncle Charles Hughes The Red Hook Grain Terminal is an abandoned grain elevator at the Gowanus Canal's mouth in Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood. \n\nBuilt in 1922, it is a 12-story concrete structure that is 429 feet long and has 54 silos, each standing 120 feet tall with 8-inch-thick walls to store combustible grain safely. \n\nPart of the New York State Canal System, it aimed to improve shipping along the Erie Canal. However, it was seen as a failure shortly after its September 1922 opening due to a decline in canal use and grain shipments. Matt, what you saw off the Gowanus Canal is a wind turbine that looks like a windmill. The Loujaine, formerly known as the Abu Loujain, is a notable vessel that originally functioned as a cement and dry cargo ship. Today, it serves a new purpose as a floating storage hulk nestled in the picturesque Gowanus Canal, located in Brooklyn, New York. This ship was constructed in 1966 in Japan for Arabian Bulk Trade (ABT) and was later adapted for specialized cement handling. After being re-acquired by ABT, it was renamed and proudly flies the Panamanian flag, marking its transformation from an operational cargo carrier to a distinctive feature along the canal’s shoreline. New Subscriber Here, I'm liking this channel Immensely! Back in the day I worked over there in Red Hook . after guy robbed the Lowe’s which is on the canal jumped in and swam across to get away from the police 24 hours later he died in local hospital due to Poisoning from swallowing some of the water Hey Matt, you are creating excellent content. It is entertaining, informative, thrilling. Your talking is so fluent and well placed. Your camera work is impressive. The fast angle changes are amazing. You are so brave to enter these areas with a tiny boat. Stay safe and keep up this superiour work. Hi question where can I get a kayak like that Matt \nYour video adventures are truly awesome this one especially. \nYou’re a brave man , thanks for the adventure. The large ship with the name you had to spell, looks like a rust bucket no longer being used. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPBKAWJQsm4 Thank you for sharing these wonderful adventures. thanks good video, would like more specific map references. Ur crazy dude u should get a lil boat would be more safe than that toy u paddling ur nutts in crazy n adventurous way best outdoor/kayaking vids\nRJ @ the Redwoods  Nice once again. I would like to kayak one day in NYC I'm from  Orlando Florida Great channel and NYC resident my entire life.  Gotta ask what that Uber cost must have ridiculously expensive lol. well do the right new york city. sell this ocean terminal to the chinese. if you cant build your mom back to life. big daddy can. @28:30, while of course they could expand their awareness, you have to do your own due diligence to ensure you are visible to other seafarers. Which Oru do you use? Awesome to see you navigate on that craft as a great test! What camera are you using to film? I like how it switches angles and what not. We have the same raw sewage discharge warnings on our local rivers. Can't help wondering if any fish live in that canal. If anyone gives you crao theu need to calm down. Yes I get the fact some people are idiots, but you make it very clear you are waiting and patiently. You are respectful and are very aware, at the same time, this is all public water. I haven't seen a sighn or gate or anything saying you cant be thier. I'm just a southern boy from North Carolina that has no interest going North but watching you cruise around on the kayak up there is peaceful to watch and pretty damn cool man 😎 My Mom was born on Carol street I used to go there in the 70's when I was young, it did not look nothing like that at all. Really hooked to your adventures. The best , i have been looking so far at the NYC so rounding areas.  Are NY area based ?  Curious about the your gear set up and where do you mount camera for different shots other than those on tripods. I’ll bet there’s some cement shoes below you! Grew up near the Gowanus Canal and the Red Hook Grain Terminal (from Gowanus, BK). My friends and I explored the Gowanus Bat Cave along the canal about a decade ago before it was redeveloped. I never knew that ship, the Loujane was there (just did some research and apparently it was owned by a Saudi cement/construction company and went out of use in the 80s!) That whole area and its eerie industrial feel always fascinated me. So cool seeing someone explore my backyard up close! 🤪 9 guys sitting around and one working . Sad they keep tearing up more Mother Earth , for what? While so much just fall apart instead of restoring. Pollution everywhere I think you need a pole maybe with a flag, or reflection lights, that survey guy made sense 19:06  friendly reminder  👋 😊 Great video.  You are a brave man.  I used to live in Brooklyn and Bike over the Canal often.  On a hot day, you could smell it, combination of sewage, fish and chemicals.  The green florescent tinge of the water never goes away.  It's been a Superfund site for over 50 years.  To say it looks clean is relative.  It is cleaner but will always be toxic. In 2009 it was declared a Superfund site. In 2012 it was declared that it would cost $467 million to $504 million to clean up. I can't find any data as to  how much they have spent so far, but they're asking for a budget of 2 billion in 2024 to continue clean up I canoed the Gowanus canal in a leaky canoe about 2005.  Half way thru the paddle the canoe stopped leaking.  Sealed watertight from the nasty ooze in the canal.  My girlfriend spent about an hour with a q-tip and nail polish remover getting all the little flecks of tar off me when we I got back. And they’re building luxury housing all around this toxic soup Trashboats. raw sewage is being released from all sewage treatment plants in NYC because the plants dont have the capacity to hold all this water flow coming into the plants from the catch basins located at each street.But this rain water along with the raw sewage is combined and treated with Hypochloride (basically chlorine) before it gets released into the bay.And again this happens only on rain events. Great stuff! Hell yea, king. Make that content amdist the collapsing dystopia among one of its many decrepit canalways. Good on ya. @twofeetoutdoors take water samples and get them analyzed and post the results.  Think you can do them free via your town usually. 41:55 not to second guess, but are you sure \"raw sewage\" enters the waterway there when it rains?  That would mean the sewer lines, and storm run-off lines, are connected, which makes NO sense to me at all.  Did you just mean that untreated stormwater enters the canal?   I would think that sewer lines are closed off and separate, and go to water treatment plants. I'm so glad you ignored those construction workers. Crazy how much of the grain terminals foundation has eroded and collapsed away. Cool exploration. that was awesome! That water is scary your brave bud I'm curious about how you film your adventures. I love how the camera rotates and was curious how you do that while you're kayaking. by yourself. Good response, \" everyone needs to be aware of their surroundings. \" Jesus dude you are talking an incredible chance in those waters. You have my respect x10! Looked like those guys just got finished dumping those portapotties. I have gone across the Union St Bridge on my bike. It was really cool seeing the bridge from the canal perspective. NYC is going to have to bestow ambassador status to you soon for all the PR work you’re doing! imagine what new york was like a hundred years ago. so much industry, so much activity in the sea. now a kind of disneyland for the wealthy. I wonder how much asbestos may be hiding in that grain terminal building? What a difference is with paddling in the urban/city  vs. Suffolk Co. kayaking. You must enjoy this more. I get it, there's more physical history to touch and witness. your channel is gem, never stop kayaking and making videos for us! 🔥🔥 Say bud being that you’re out in the NY NJ area what if you wonder into a dead squealer?😂😂😂😂 awesome Wow, it takes guts to do what you're doing.I hope you had all your shots. And I don't mean your shots from your camera.I mean the shots.💉new york is so disgusting . I think the buildings at @4:32 are where they filmed the last season of DareDevil. This was Mayor Kingpins \"project\". The Loujaine is so rusted! GOLLY! nice friendly construction workers.  typical new yorkers Daaamn... Where do you get the energy from??? 😫 i was waiting for this video Amazing to think that when my dad was a kid in the late 1920's he used to swim in that canal. I thought they were cleaning it and dredging it Shipwreck at Carroll St Lofts with waterfront odor. I passed over the canal my whole life and wondered what it would be like to kayak there. This answers life-long questions. Thank You We really need a map in a corner somewhere showing where you are with landmarks if possible. Every video I am trying to follow your route on google maps lol Came here for the EPA stuff and only a little bit for the exploration. Please don’t get stabbed to death by a junkie!!!! 😢 😢😢 so very tragic and yet it makes you wonder how the narrative is perpetuated that the farms are the ones polluting the rivers and waterways. 🤔🤔🤔 Matt, we’re thankful for your expose🙏🙏🙏. There are countless number of cities polluting their waterways in the same manner.👎👎👎 Great video !  Thank You ! So do u glow in the dark now?😂 great video I would love to come along with you on some of your adventures. Are you just a solo act? :-) @9:28 I think it's pronounced like lou ann? Idk. Cajun name?\nIt's hull is in bad condition. Needs some love. I think I saw Kramer swimming by. Now instead of glowing green its dark green now👍 Swimming in Live Gohnarea 😮😮😮 NY Dems: yay! Let’s spend money!  It grows on trees! My ancestor built the first residence in Brooklyn, and it was on the Gowanus. I love this project! We need it. The sewage company and EPA should be responsible big time, after all the decades 2024aaaaaa now we're doing something, you covering something NY I cannot believe that dude swam in it! Gow-ANUS....  Yeah right they ain't really cleaning it up, just another way to make people think politicians are worth anything. heard of this canal from blue bloods, crazy Ny has waters like somalia A little baking soda will clean that right up Back in the day, me and my buddies used to catch and eat fish from the canal.  Good times! 😋 Saw it today ! Thousand of floating and serfaced fish ! Why not drain it, then clean it, then fill it back up again? LMAO... smelly toxic Gowanus I tease my friends from Brooklyn that they were baptized in the canal! Would Don or Ron show up for this?  I don't think so...   Too \"woke\" for them! Where am I gonna dump all the bodies if they clean this 🧐 Wen can we swim in the Hudson River? The yr 3050? They'd have to dig down a mile to clean it up just to start. Adams should now swim there. it is still INFECTED mafia used it to get rid rid of their victims and trashes dump Funera homesl,hospitals  ,slaughter house dump their stuff their too and LL continue. Fill in the gowanas canal and build low income housing on it The cheapest solution should be to have the street drainage (not sewage waste) diverted to help flush it out.....I am not a civil engineer, but i did sleep at a Motel Six. Fill it in. It is a fossil of a different age, when this area was a natural wetland, and there was constant flow of water from the surrounding marshes which flushed it out.\nNow it is a stagnant lagoon, which is bound to revert to its nasty state surrounded by an urban environment...... Any three eyed fish? The history is people just thought they should dump anything and everything in the canal... did they find the surveillance video tape from MCC on Jeffery Epstein? No Jimmy Hoffa ? That WW2 rescue boat didn't turn up from dreadging... it's always been there at water level or barely just below at low tide..  it's been there for decades. Fill it with NYC garbage , then put a thin layer of soil and some grass seeds. Call it it the Meadowlands.  That what we  did in Jersey. Federal money to create waterfront property. I don't want my tax dollars spent to make upscale development possible. Do exactly what was done with other sections of abandoned canals in New York: fill it in and turn it into a wide street. they want to build more apts. Even There bad english😂 If you REALLY want to see something you need to be there when it rains and see the CSOs start to flow.\nThe smell and the stuff you see come out is just incredible. What's really crazy is that canal is attached to Manhattan harbor, the east river and the hudson river. So all that deadly water has spread. I recently saw a video discussing the conditions of the water in that canal and I couldn't believe how toxic and dangerous that water really is. A man commented saying he worked on tugboats in nyc waters and said the canal is so toxic that if anyone ever fell into that water they would not pull them out to put them in the same boat because it would risk everyones health on the boat. Since the 1700s all sorts of things were dumped into the gowanus canal. From dead animals, chemicals. Sewage. You name it, it was thrown in the canal. Great to hear it's being cleaned but the soil on the bottom is what really needs to be removed. Finally something good out of NYC ! Housing around that nasty canal? Oh come on. Even after cleanup I wouldn’t live there ok Decades to clean up - meanwhile, people are living right above it. 💀 Greedy developers have no concience. They dont give a dam how polluted that thing is. Its still going to be an open sewage. At this moment its full of coronavirus and when it goes through the pump and splashes, it gets all over the air. Nice place to live ha? That’s. A. Man or woman Natalie, looking decent! I wonder how many guns they found????? I remember as a child in the late 70's crossing that canal on the way to Redhook swimming pool and that canal would reek of eggs. What an awful unbearable smell. To think kids swam in it back in the days. Remember that dolphin? lots of kids swam there in the 1960s SLAVES TOO Judge Crater? Those Fish took a wrong turn,dang😞 On my page it shows all different videos and clips. I worked there It would really be news if it said 'LIVE FISH SPOTTED IN GOW-ANUS' Or a big bubble sprinkler head with a pump.. Just sayin Dated a girl living in Gowanus..the smell of dead fish from yknow where kinda precipitated the eventual breakup 😆😉 The msm and democrats are so worried about climate change but don’t care that our water and land are contaminated with chemicals. As usual these \"Activists\" have no clue this happens every year the bait fish school up in the millions deplete the oxygen and die as well as algae blooms 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦 This moron said heavy rains... What about the monsoon regions in the world they have fish die offs?  🤔 I like the guy complaining about the rain we have had. We haven't had enough rain! Keep feeding people BS stories.  I've killed more fish then that in a day for lobster bait! I wanna know when someone sees a live fish. New York has a brand Why do people live near this highly contaminated waterway?   The old Staten Island Dump has tons of chemicals and pollution as well....who knows what leaks out of there and ends up in Brooklyn! 😂 they killed the fish with 💩 💩 💩 That was dead bunker...not a eating fish..only bait fish That’s y I couldn’t catch any fish the other night 🤦🏾‍♂️ Superfund cleanup. GTFOH. This is natural occurring thing that happens when blue fish chase bunker fish it causes a😊 fish stampede that causes all the bunker fish to eat all the oxygen. It happens  all the time. Just the news making drama for people that have no knowledge of fish and nature We have to stop people from other countries from coming to America There the one that have the chemical and chemistry to do this No lie I think it’s the Chinese that are doing this the gowanus canal will never be clean they need to drain it and put new water or make a new street They are dumping Bud Light there. The fish are just sleeping it off. It was the herpes Bunker tend to go into back bays when chased down by bluefish and strippers so many bunker eat up oxygen fill the shit in     what happened to the  flushing tunnel ??? Its bunker from the bay that swam into gowanus and died from lack of oxygen in the water bc of the fetid muck. Happens often. Did they clean that thing up? I remember it being so bad you wouldn't notice dead fish \"New York Has A Brand\" - said by NYC Mayor Eric Adams 😮😮😮😮 if you read up on the history of what polluted it and for how long and then read about how inept the local government is at planning and cleaning it up you would know that anyone alive today will not be swimming in that canal without some kind of special equipment I grew up just off the canal, 2nd street, and i say.....NEVER! \nLocals used to swim in it prior to the pumping station breaking down and everyone who did got sick.  Soooo....🤷‍♂️ Although a swimmable Gowanus Canal is a wonderful dream, changing the classification of the canal primarily serves to make at least some of the water quality standards enforceable in a way that they currently are not. That the water would ever become clean enough to swim in is really questionable, as there will always be sewage at least flowing into some parts of the canal during periods of extreme rainfall. Kayaking is one thing, but swimming without extremely high-quality protective gear? I don't think so. Yet I seen no other people outside other than the 2 of you. Does anybody remember that part of the program doing the 50s and the 60s in the 70s and the 80s? Don't don't judge. You know? I used to hear Stories. When that was one of the favorite places, people dump in bodies.  Cause it was polluted when rats and rats would eat whatever was whatever fell into the water. I remember going to group on my friends couple of times in the summer, we usually tie chicken bones and stuff to strengthen the rope and throw it in there and fight with the rats, at least we think there were rats, water rats.  They supposed to be big.\n Insurance, but I don't know what pulled it cause. We never really saw it cause. The water was so dark and dirty. So it might be stories or there might be a couple of million people in there. A couple tons of guns that we use in violence and nights. Oh, somebody in the government's gonna realize this.  I don't think all these plans.You're gonna go through right away.Cause every time they dig up a body that's a lot of money spent Can you please find out from the activist/s in that area WHY A HELPLESS DOLPHIN was allowed to die a horrible death two decades ago in the disgusting sewer called the GOWANUS CANAL right somewhere in the Astoria area ??  \nWould appreciate it.  Thank you. ❤ Brother in law was lucky to get a place in Park Slope before Sandy.  His apartment was filled nearly full with sludge/sewage from Gowanus. Poor dolphins have died there. Gow-anus! I like your channel. But if you are speaking about the Gowanus canal clean up, you should note the engineering project before the dredging was allowed to begin. You should look up the Gowanus Flushing Tunnel and facility at the head of the canal. Good work. Jimmy Hoffa is somewhere in the canal. NYC waa just as bad as London...No OYSTERS please .... yuck 🤢🦪 This channel should be given some sort of social and urban archeological award. Great program God bless hipsters all for you In Pittsburgh, we have sewage treatment plants that treat the sewage before we dump the water back into the rivers leading into the Ohio River, which supplies water for Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe sewage plants remove the slug (aka poop) from the sewage, then bakes (like baking a cake) and sends the slug to a landfill.  The remaining water mixture is purified to the point of being drinkable.  The water is sent to the Ohio River to provide water for Cincinnati. \nSide factoid: During the drought of 1988, Pittsburgh sent less water down to Cincinnati.   Pittsburgh dams held back water for Cincinnati. \nDumping raw sewage into the canal is so uncivilized.   If New York asked Pittsburgh, we'd show you how to treat water, then you will be able to eat your clams. Answer: The Gowanus will be high end waterfront real estate, ironically built on a toxic waste dump, with $0 land cost. IT USED TO CATCH FIRE!\n\nSERIOUSLY, A WATER CANAL THAT WOULD CATCH ON FIRE, THINK ABOUT THAT. Disgusting. Reminds me of when I was a kid in the ‘60’s my mom would take me and my sister to Red Hook to visit some churches in the area for Good Friday. I would be terrified walking over the bridge at the canal. The water was green with oil globs floating in it and the smell was awful. I imagined some monster must have been living under that polluted mess. I saw your earlier video on the streets around the canal. 😊😊 Oysters do such great work counteracting raw sewage Where did all of the contaminated sediment go once it was dredged?  Open ocean? But but, I was told it is beautiful clean coals. It really does look like Copenhagen! Greattttt ! Soon it will be like the Venice Canal…. 😂 They have a Whole Foods in Gowanus!  It's a trending nabe.  New York real estate development is truly weird. I am amazed. 30 years this was a NO GO area. Amazing whas a little Clean Up can do. Where did the contaminated sludge go? Anybody else notice that Oysters are nature filters for water, What about the Coney Island Creek? Great video! That Canal is poison, just ask the dolphin that swam in there some years ago. As a kid I'd have nightmares that I would fall in. I don't live too far from here and it's insane to me how much money has been spent on buildings along the canal. I don't care if they're dredging, those tenants are breathing in fumes. How many dead mobsters do you think they will find? 👍👍👍 I love your video, huge fan. But this one tickled my itch. I don't like this, to start with mankind took a natural environment and polluted it, terraformed it and transformed it into its current form today. Nature was devastated by this process but whilst there was a massive ecological impact life survived, adapted and evolved. That is where we are today. Now mankind is trying to 'restore' the previous natural state of the waterway. The process to achieve that is invasive sudden and severe chemical and physical alteration. This is as abrupt and destructive to the current natural state as was the original desecration. You are repeating the error. if you want this to transform back to its natural state. To heal. Stop! Stop all human intervention and activity. Let nature reclaim and rehabilitate in her own way. Anything else is just furthering the original thinking and destruction, for the sake of what 'looks good' to people. When are we going to stop destroying our environment whilst all along thinking we know best and that we are good? There is no greater evil than this. I cant even imagine myself for working *20 years* to restore some random salt marsh, thats just insane to me.\n\nThis type of stuff just reaffirms the necessity of capitalism more than anything else. What do you know; it works. Love your tic tocs, I love the history and story's of Americans, Being British we have lots of history. So I like to learn American history. The architectural story's . Keep it up. Iv subbed Now 🎉❤ A concrete park ok... Thank god the new president cares so much about the environment and ecological conditions that impact people and the other living creatures there. Pretty sure anything with the words “green” in it was just defunded by the doge $2 trilly recovery squad and the mess made all for $150 billion “in savings” (erasing US soft power globally) for the US govt not even remotely touching the military?? What a freaking joke man. Sad that projects like this will no longer get govt funding to clean up if they were already which imo they should be. We needed that infrastructure money bad! Things are crumbling and for some reason we gotta constantly only pay attention to what books shouldn’t be  in classrooms and other craziness!! If I swim there, will I gain super powers? Future of the Guwanus will be more residential and mixed use gentrification. Like every where else in the vicinity of Manhattan. 50 years ago Brooklyn and manhattan were commercial-manufacturing and authentic people living working and middle class lives. Now it is residential buildings built solely for money laundering and for the wealthy and their children from all over the country and the world. With financial firms moving out the main business of NYC is now catering to the wealthy who live in or invest in these expensive properties. My God imagine how beautiful it was. And the United States has the nerve to tell other country's how to behave environmentally. They burn coal for 160 years? Lol China does it for 50 in the world condemns them So interesting! Amazing infrastructure revamp. Liked your comment that it looks like Copenhagen or London. Good comments. Go anus! I wanna live there. I see what's happening. Love your channel, man! Wonder what they did with all that junk they dug up Many dead bodies have ended up in there, too. That part will continue. Try and keep the urban campers from relieving themselves in it or drowning in it after they have lost control of themselves. I love living in a metropolis. Every day is an adventure. Go Anus canal. So, where did they send the stuff that was dredged up? You should do an episode on Newtown Creek in Williamsburg Peter Cooper’s factory used to dump in there then there was a major gas and oil company that polluted that one you can still see oil barriers in the creek to this day. I read a old newspaper article on it crazy. Everything  is possible I work at UPS and would love to see the history of UPS in New York if that would be possible Keep it up! It’s so cool to see redevelopment and conservation like this going on. Every time I pass by, I am consistently surprised that people have willingly decided to live there now. This is especially since the canal still floods during (for now) uncommon massive storms and deposits that sewage everywhere. I personally feel it large parts of it should have been turned back into an undeveloped marsh area for reducing flood risks in higher elevation areas nearby. I know nyc needs more houses but this isn’t a wise location to build housing. Wow. Looks way better than when I lived near it about 15 years ago! Happy to see this Bro this was almost a year ago for there to be fish there means the water quality have improved significantly since they been dumping there I’m pretty sure thats the fourth street basin. It’s close to my house, and I’ve fished there and caught some bluefish. It’s the 3 eyed fish. 1:42 Why is that person putting their hand in the water without gloves?! Live Gonnerah?!?!?!? bless you chris, love this gross canal Dumbass Eww. Gross. idiot guy THIS IS REAL? These people saying \"these kids smelt it\"  \"once they caught a whiff of it\"\nand the place is basically named CowAnus? smell of crap or sewage See what happens when you hire The Best of the Best and they call you guys the basket of deplorable look who's laughing now people Great \nNow we have corpses & barges in that sewer\nGreat job What's up with her tone? Like I kept expecting her to say \"gosh darn\". Lady its spilling CONTAMINANTS into our oceans! Bruh Gotham city. I was born and raised on Baltic & Bond - just down the block from the \"Boutique Hotel\" she mentions. One block from the Gowanus Canal, and I can't even describe the deep, slimy green sludge that they call water. The smell during half the year - mostly late Spring and Summer. My mother, 3 sisters, uncle and his wife, all died from cancer. All between the ages of mid 40's to late 50's - no one made it past 60, mostly Leukemia and lung, organ cancers. Everyone was in good to very good health at time of diagnosis. Gentrifiers and Hipsters maybe have an immunity, who knows. The Gowanus Canal was definitely the common denominator for my family though. Great trendy restaurants and expensive condos and hotels! Something there totally isn’t in nyc thank god! Now the lower class who live there will be pushed out congrats you stupid Trendy hipsters jesus fuck Stop gentrification in Brooklyn stoppppp The toxicity levels are no joke, it has been dangerous for decades, laugh now before those tumors arise.

Photo by Susan De Vries Registerto leave a comment, orlog inif you already have an account With more than 1,000 apartments, including about 250 designated affordable, the redesigned project’s concrete towers will rise as high as 27 stories. Rendering by Bucharest Studio via Bjarke Ingels Group Speculation around what will rise at 175 3rd Street is over with developers Charney Companies and Tavros Capital unveiling renderings of a massive new residential project that will bring more than 1,000 apartments—and a striking new silhouette—to the prominent Gowanus site. Architecture firms Bjarke Ingels Group and dencityworks|architecture are behind the staggered series of concrete and glass towers that rise up to 27 stories, arranged in a stepped formation along 3rd Street between the Gowanus Canal and 3rd Avenue. With gridded facades, sharp chamfered angles, and exposed structural elements, the development has an elegant, original form. With more height, density, and more than twice as many units as the firm’s first design for the site under a different owner, it rises suddenly and steeply from the sidewalk to tower over its low-rise neighbors. These include the historic red-brickPowerhouse Artsbuilding and, across the street, Whole Foods, the Coignet Building, and the American Can Company building (all landmarks apart from the grocery store). This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply. Charney principal Sam Charney told theNew York Postthe new design aims to respect its industrial context, describing the buildings as appearing “chiseled out of rock”—a departure from earlier plans for a red-brick development he said “drowned out” the adjacent landmark. That landmark, once known as the Batcave, will no longer be visible from the street, as the towers will occupy a former Verizon parking lot in front of it. Possibly the 3rd Street Bridge will afford a glimpse. BIG’s earlier conceptfor the site resembled a tiered wedding cake or swooping rollercoaster with a walkable public ramp gradually winding up to the pinnacle and a lush, canal-side park below. That design, which included 374 apartments over 651,000 square feet, was more sculptural and potentially more costly and challenging to build. In contrast, the new plans more than double the unit count and increase density and height. Renderings show greenery plays a central role in softening the development’s strong edges, with trees and plantings on terraces, rooftops, and balconies. At 1,080,000 square feet, the all-electric complex will include ground-floor retail and artist spaces as well as a 28,000-square-foot canal-facing public esplanade designed by Field Operations in collaboration with the Parks Department, the developers said in press materials. Mechanicals will be elevated for flood resilience, and a quarter of the apartments, or about 250, will be designated affordable under the city’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. The nearly 3-acre site waspurchasedby the developers for $160 million in April after previous owners RFR secured a 421-a tax break and did remediation work. This marks the fourth Gowanus project for Charney and Tavros, collectively known as “Gowanus Wharf,” the developers specified in a fact sheet, although the sites are not adjacent. All four represent more than 2 million square feet of new development and approximately 2,000 units. The other three, Nevins Port, Union Channel, and Douglass Port, were designed by Fogarty Finger. Construction is expected to begin once work is completed on the group’s other neighborhood sites, likely sometime next year, according to the Post.

The site at 175 3rd Street last month. Photo by Susan De Vries An attention-grabbing design by prominent Brooklyn architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG, for a parking lot on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 3rd Street in Gowanus seems unlikely to move forward now that the property has changed hands. While the new owners declined to comment specifically on their plans for the design, commissioned by the site’s previous owner, they did tell Brownstoner they intend to build a 1,000-unit residential development with 1 million square feet — more than twice the size of the previous project. The three-acre site alongside the Gowanus Canal at 175 3rd Street comes already remediated and with a  valuable 421-a tax break. Developers Tavros Capital and Charney Companies purchased it for $160 million from developer RFR on April 30, the seller announced last week. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply. Charney Companies COO Justin Pelsinger told Brownstoner via email that the 3rd Street parcel was “a truly scarce opportunity—one of the final large-scale multi-family development parcels left in Gowanus, and indeed, much of Brooklyn,” and said the investment reflects the developers’ commitment to shaping the neighborhood’s future. Across the street from Whole Foods and running along 3rd Street from 3rd Avenue to the canal and the 3rd Street Bridge in front ofPowerhouse Arts, the property will be the fourth Gowanus project for the company. Used as a Verizon parking lot for decades, it contains a brick building on one side and a metal shed on the other. The developers have worked with architecture firmFogarty Fingeron their three other developments in the neighborhood, known collectively asGowanus Wharf, although they are not adjacent. Gowanus Wharf comprises Nevins Port at 320 and 340 Nevins Street, Union Channel at 240 3rd Avenue, and Douglass Port at 251 Douglass Street. Union Channel, the farthest along, has held anaffordable housing lotteryand recently started leasing. The acquisition of 175 3rd Street brings their projects in the area to a total of 2,200 units and more than 2 million square feet under development, Pelsinger said. Bjarke Ingels Group imagined astriking waterfront structure tiered like a wedding cake, with a walkable public ramp winding past apartments to the top of the building, and a lush canal-side park open to the public. The design included 450 apartments over 651,433 square feet. The property comes with eligibility for the Brownfield Credit Program. RFR, which purchased the site in 2018 for $115 million, secured the incentives, conducted environmental remediation, and obtained excavation and foundation permits before the sale, according to the company. To finance the purchase, Tavros and Charney secured $145 million from Silver Point Capital, The Brodsky Organization, and Tikehau Capital, according toThe Real Deal. Previous owner RFR “recognized potential in Gowanus early and secured critical tax incentives, pushed forward a best-in-class design, and positioned the project to meet the area’s surging demand for housing,” RFR principal Aby Rosen said in a prepared statement. As of now, Tavros and Charney have not filed any new building permits or released updated design plans for the site. Emailtips@brownstoner.comwith further comments, questions or tips.

Quite a few camera crews and and local residents gathered on the Union Street bridge in Gowanus this morning to witness clean water activistChristopher Swain's second attempt to swim the entire 1.8 mile length of the Gowanus Canal Superfund site.His first try this past springwas cut short after just 2/3rd of a mile because of weather concerns.Swain's goal is to bring attention to one of the most polluted waterways in America and to call for an accelerated, comprehensive cleanup, resulting in a \"Gowanus Canal that is safe for swimming every day.\"Before todays swim, theUS Environmental Protection Agencyhad cautioned Swain against getting into the Gowanus, stating: \"\"The Unites States Environmental Protection Agency—leader of the cleanup of the sludge at the bottom of the Canal—recognized Swain’s legal right to swim in the Canal, but has advised Swain against swimming in it at all. In a letter delivered to Swain on Wednesday, the Agency wrote: “EPA strongly advises against swimming in the Gowanus Canal. Swimming in the waters of the Gowanus Canal poses a risk from exposure to site related hazardous chemicals as well as pathogens associated with sewage discharge.”That obviously did not deter Swain. Shortly after 11 Am, the activist, dressed in a protective yellow suit and wearing a cap with the word \"hope\" handwritten on it, climbed down from the Union Street bridge and got into a canoe.  Amidst applause and shouts of \"Go, Swain\" and \"Good luck, Christopher\", he and his team made their way to the head of the canal at Butler Street.Once there, Swain climbed out of the canoe and entered the greenish, smelly waters.Within minutes, he had made his way through oil sheen and raw sewage back to the Union Street Bridge, waving to the crowd and stopping just  long enough to say: \"Sometimes, someone has to put himself on the line for something to change.\"He then turned around and continued towards the Carroll Street Bridge and hopefully towards his goal.Not everyone seemed impressed.  A young man shook his head in disbelief and said: \"Guy swims in dirty water. So what!  For this I left work?\"****Update**Swain completed the entire 1.8 mile swim in the Gowanus Canal at 12:37:44 pm. (The official start time was 11:25:50 am).Eymund Diegel,who accompanied Swain to the finish line in his canoe , reports that the activist is doing quite well after this second time in the polluted canal.Diegel writes: \"\"Chris is actually in great shape.  Swimming is apparently quite healthy for you.  He just had ice cream from Ample Hills - the flavor \"It Came from Gowanus\" renamed to \"He Came from Gowanus\" for today.\"The photos below were taken by Diegel as Swain was completing his goal.(photo credit: Eymund Diegel)Read more Gowanus 2007Gowanus 2008Gowanus 2007Gowanus 2007As mentioned previously, theNew York City Department of City Planning (DCP)has just released the long awaitedGowanus Draft Zoning Proposal.  Many in the community are trying to understand and to envision what Gowanus will look like in the future, ifthe proposed rezoning, which calls for  22 to 30-story buildings, does go through as proposed.  Others are looking to the past, cognizant of the fact that much of the neighborhood's history could easily be erased forever as a result of the rezoning.TheGowanus Landmarking Coalitionwas formed in the summer of 2017 to seek New York City landmark designation for key historical, architectural, and cultural sites in Gowanus prior to the neighborhood rezoning.The coalition is made up of Gowanus residents, local businesses,  and the following organizations.Park Slope Civic Council,The Old Stone House,Historic Districts Council,Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus (FROGG).It's mission is \"to ensure that Gowanus retains an authentic sense of place - and remains capable of telling its own many-layered story.\"The Gowanus Landmarking Coalition has just issued the press release below. Please support its mission andsign the petition to protect Gowanus' built environment prior to the City Planning Commission's rezoning.Gowanus Landmarking Coalition Launches Website Ahead of RezoningGOWANUS -  The Gowanus Landmarking Coalition unveiled its new website today in advance of tonight’s public meeting regarding the city’s Gowanus rezoning plan.The website can be found at:www.gowanuslandmarks.orgThe new site highlights the Coalition’s priority list of fifteen sites and small districts in Gowanus that warrant official designation by the City of New York.Having waited more than two years for the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission to conclude its study of potential Gowanus landmarks for designation, the Coalition continues to press public officials to designate and protect critical sites before rezoning arrives in the neighborhood.“We’ve seen this before in recent city-led neighborhood rezonings,” said Coalition member and Gowanus resident Brad Vogel, “Landmarking has been left as something of an afterthought in places like East Harlem, Inwood, and East New York when it needs to happen prior to the major changes that come with city-led rezonings.  We hope the city will take a better course here in Gowanus.”Some groups in the Coalition have been advocating for landmark designation in Gowanus for more than a decade.  And during that time, several quintessentially Gowanus sites, likethe Burns Brothers Coal Pockets, have been lost to demolition.“We invite community members to sign our petition found at the new Coalition website,” said Kelly Carroll of the Historic Districts Council.  “Gowanus should not be left with a paltry 3 or 4 designated landmarks when the rezoning dust settles.  Telling the full story of this neighborhood’s industrial and maritime heritage requires more than a dozen sites.  Our Coalition priority list is a good start.”The Coalition, comprised of city-wide, neighborhood, and historical groups, continues to meet with elected officials and city agencies to advocate for landmark designation.“Historic interpretation signage in the neighborhood as proposed by the city sounds nice.  But first we need to save the buildings that still exist and give Gowanus a real sense of place,” said Linda Mariano of Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus.  “We ask our public officials to do right by Gowanus and landmark the important buildings shown on our website as soon as possible.”Here is a list of sites identified by the Gowanus Landmarking Coalition as landmark worthy.Gowanus Flushing Tunnel Pumping Station, 209 Douglass StreetASPCA Memorial Building, 238 Butler StreetGowanus Station, 234 Butler StreetBRT Powerhouse, 322 Third AvenueNational Packing Box Factory, 280 Nevins StreetT.H.

Though various stakeholders and  representatives from local organizations had been invited, the meeting was not announced to the public, not posted in any way on the internet,not open to the general public and was closed to the press.Councilman Brad Lander, when faced with the criticism in the press,wrote a letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Paperstating that the meeting 'was not secret' and  promised that Bridging Gowanus would\"be an effort to open up the planning process so that community residents, business people, and community groups can work together to shape a vision for the area around the Gowanus Canal rather than have decisions made by developers, the city, or by elected officials.\"Subsequent Bridging Gowanus meetings held throughout 2014 were indeed publicized and well attended.  However,  the meetings were eerily controlled and orchestrated byPratt Center for Community Development, which had been hired by Lander as consultant in charge of running the planning process.Participants were divided amongst several tables where Pratt Center moderators seemed to lead the conversation according to a carefully scripted plan that led to a pre-determined outcome,  It all seemed designed to give the appearance of community input rather than to actually achieve it.In November 2014, Pratt Center for Community Development presented the findings of the \"Bridging Gowanus.\"  These findings, the community was told, would help develop a neighborhood framework for \"the infrastructure and land use plan needed for a safe, vibrant and sustainable Gowanus.\" The 'shared values' reflected in the framework are \"going to hopefully guide New York City Planning and the De Blasio Administration when a re-zoning plan for Gowanus will be put forth.\"Though groups and organizations like the Fifth Avenue Committee, Gowanus Alliance, Gowanus Dredgers, and Wyckoff Gardens Tenants Association expressed their approval of the framework, quite a few local residents objected to the assertion by Pratt and Councilman Lander that many in Gowanus were open to high rises from 8 to 18 stories to achieve the goals set forth by Bridging Gowanus.The density had been determined by a rather misleadingexercise given to residents at the public meeting in Junewhich asked residents to add two stories to a four story building for every amenity, like school, park or art space, that would be added to the neighborhood. Those who checked off every amenity ended up with residential buildings up to 18 stories high.To Lander, it was all a trade off for providing more parkland, more schools, more affordable housing and protection of manufacturing zones in Gowanus.\"We did ask people to think hard of the tradeoffs that are necessary,\" Brad Lander commented. \"These kinds of investments and achieving the level of preservation we just talked about costs a lot of money.\"It is interesting to note that 'Bridging Gowanus' is not the first time the community was asked to envision the future of the neighborhood. Back in 2007, Pratt Center helped conveneGowanus Summit, \"a coalition of civic, housing and community development, manufacturing, and labor groups to establish ground rules for development around the Gowanus Canal.\"The summit \"aimed to ensure that new development meets the needs of area residents and sets high standards for local quality of life.\"Even more interesting,Brad Lander was the director for Pratt Center for Community Developmentin 2007.Shortly afterwards, in May 2008, while Bill de Blasio was our councilman, theNew York City Department of City Planningreleased itsGowanus Canal Corridor Draft Zoning ProposalThe agency was ready to push a major re-zoning through, though there was much opposition from the community.That re-zoning effort was eventually put on hold after the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Gowanus Canal a Superfund in 2009.The prospect of a re-zoning has caused developers to circle around the neighborhood like sharks in a feeding frenzy. Since 2008, most of the land around the Gowanus Canal has been snapped up in a veritable gold rush.  But before that land is re-zoned from manufacturing to residential, they can't start building their luxury condos.Developers are probably calling our elected officials on a regular basis to apply pressure (or, perhaps to host fundraisers and contribute to campaigns).Which brings me back to last Thursday's meeting.After all his promises and assurances that the Bridging Gowanus process and subsequent re-zoning will be transparent and inclusive, Councilman Brad Lander should know better than to 'step up' the process without announcing it to the community.Shame on him.***As of this morning, Catheribe Zinnel of Lander's office had not provided the requested attendance list for last Thursday's meeting.  Nor did she provide a list of attendees of another 'Bridging Gowanus Part 2' meeting that took place earlier on Thursday.Read more Voice of Gowanus at a press conference at noon todayMembers ofVoice of Gowanusheld a press conference at noon today to announce that its coalition of neighborhood civic groups has retained a lawyer and an environmental consultant to challenge New York City's rezoning of the massive Gowanus rezoning from industrial/manufacturing to mostly residential.Of course, Pardon Me For Asking was there to capture the event...and to speak.Please take a look at the video to understand why VoG is opposed to the rezoning,Below find Voice of Gowanus' statement on retaining legal council. I encourage everyone to contribute toGowanus Legal Defense Fund.January 12, 2021VOICE OF GOWANUS LAWYERS UP IN REZONE FIGHTCoalition Retains Counsel, Mulls Challenge To Gowanus RezoningGOWANUS, BROOKLYN – Voice of Gowanus, a grassroots community coalition, announced today that it has retained legal counsel and is contemplating possible legal challenges to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s and City Planning’s deeply flawed rezoning proposed for Gowanus, Brooklyn.“The proposed rezoning stinks worse than the Gowanus Canal on a bad day,” said Katia Kelly of Voice of Gowanus.  “We’ve retained counsel, and we’ll fight the city’s ill-advised plan in court if we must.”Attorney Jason Zakai of the law firm Hiller, P.C. will represent Voice of Gowanus as legal counsel, working with the group’s legal committee, which itself is comprised of several attorneys.  Hiller, PC is the leading opposition land-use, zoning and preservation law firm in New York City. Dedicated to preserving neighborhoods and protecting communities from out-of-control development, the firm regularly takes on legal challenges against arbitrary and capricious City land-use approvals, or those that violate lawful procedure.“There are serious problems both with the massive rezoning proposal itself, and with the lack of transparency concerning the proposal, and we are looking into all legal options on behalf of our client,” Zakai said. “Rather than move forward with such a problematic plan, the City should go back to the drawing board and shelve it for another day.”Voice of Gowanus previously launched theGowanus Legal Defense Fundto raise financial support for the legal effort and continues to fundraise.  An outpouring of community support for the Fund indicates the intense level of concern about a rezoning that stands to increase raw sewage overflows into the Gowanus Canal and compromise the Gowanus superfund cleanup.The rezoning, which seeks to permit 22-30 story luxury residential towers in a vulnerable flood zone, also proposes placing housing on Public Place, one of the most toxic sites in the city, which will never be fully cleaned of plumes of carcinogenic coal tar extending 100 feet below the surface.“We’re also excited to announced that Voice of Gowanus has retained environmental administrative law expert Maureen Koetz, a veteran of earlier fights against wanton rezoning actions here in New York City,” said Jack Riccobono of Voice of Gowanus. “We are ready to go to the mat to stop this incredibly unwise push to rezone a neighborhood during a pandemic.”Voice of Gowanus has also repeatedly raised concerns about the city’s strange rush to ram the rezoning through during the middle of the global pandemic.“Protecting our community’s rights to due process and ensuring that laws are followed even during a pandemic are top priorities for us,” said Brad Vogel of Voice of Gowanus. “Just because a mayor or council member’s term will be ending doesn’t mean the rules regarding land use review can be suspended.  Especially when the proposed rezoning is as drastic and unsustainable as the one being put forward here in Gowanus.”For more on Voice of Gowanus and concerns about the Gowanus rezoning:www.voiceofgowanus.orgJack Riccobono of Voice of GowanusBrad Vogel, VoG memberAlicia Boyd ofThe Movement to Protect the People (MTOPP)Linda LaViolette of VoGRead more", "tiktok": "🫣 What do you think is the future of Gowanus in Brooklyn? NYC’s most polluted canal is undergoing a massive transformation, with high-rise residential construction. But will it be a pleasant place to live? The Gowanus Canal Conservancy is ensuring that the transformation has a positive impact on the environment and the community. #nyclife #brooklyn\nMost of the gentrified and luxury developed areas of Brooklyn are some of the most toxic. The largest property in Williamsburg was owned by the Sanitation Dept 😞🤫\nGowanus glows in the dark. All those transplants moving into the new condos will not be happy in 20 years when they are glowing in the dark too.\nThe city only cares about the environment in these neighborhoods when the minorities are forced out of the area. All these years the river has remained polluted/neglected but now because there are rich white people moving there, it matters…\nBrooklyn Native here: The canal is still dirty and its smells like rotten eggs in the summer and they pulled a dead body out of the canal last year, but the gentrifiers love building luxury buildings by waterways even if it’s toxic & dirty 🤷🏽‍♀️\nIma tell yall RN. To everyone coming to this neighborhood, renting $3000+apts on the gowanus, as a native, THIS IS THE DUMBEST place to live. It stinks 24/7. It floods everytime it rains. Oh and its TOXIC. Yall gentrified my neighborhood to live on trash.\nForgot to mentioned the bodies dumped in there as well. Gowanas didn’t get this amount of attention until people with Money moved in after 2000.\nIt took high rises and greedy developers for people to invest in the gowanus clean up. happy we got here but at what cost?\nThey calling it Venice of Brooklyn lmao Natural habitat for the Coney Island Whitefish. 🤢 My iPhone 4s is decaying at the bottom of the canal. It’s been there since 2014 🥀🥀 The smell is yikes 😖😩 Alot of it from 2 cycle engines, oil mixed with gas. My father ran the crane on the dock for Cerified Concrete during the 70’s and 80’s in Newtown Creek. Help I thought this was rocks Discowater. Lavender Lake lives Went to a gallery opening years ago that was all trippy photos of the pollution on the canal. I didn't tell my friends I brought along what they were photos of and they thought it all looked so beautiful until they found out. The most polluted waterway on the eastern seaboard And the governor says I can’t have a gas stove I grew up there, it’s very polluted and God knows what’s in there. They have been cleaning it up for many years so I don’t know, but it smells better than it used to. I lived just blocks away for 20 years. No I wouldn't want to live right next to that chemical death trap. Mob graveyard ?? There is no bigger mafia than the US government.. and I think they even did worse Not to mention that chlamydia causing bacteria was found in the canal in 2018 and gonorrhea in 2007 but no longer was there proof of cholera 😱 Have a drink at two times and then be put into the drink ha😂 Old Nayb - poison water / maybe a dragged clean up with fresh solar water flowing through ? I swam in it one drunken night the hipsters lazy river I watch them pull up many skeletons outta there....best place to drop anything... I saw a jellyfish in there a long time ago, Just swimming with the trash. That was a mutant bro, not a jellyfish CEMENT BOOTS WHERE THE THING, I LIVE 100 FEET FROM IT. the mosquitoes in Gowanus are enough to keep me away let alone the flooding Copenhagen comps aside, it’s wonderful they’re going to try to clean it up, even if it’s just for commercial gain. The cleanup will help the visiting and residing birds and other wildlife Weren’t the people working at Royal Palms getting sick bc of the canal fumes? I have a poster in my living room that says CREATURES OF THE GOWANUS CANAL with a bunch of cute little creatures on it. Anyway, I love Gowanus gowanus is literally just whole foods and GGs fish and chips town for me You can swim in the gowanus if you are pure of heart At least the people moving here can afford those medical bills from the health complications. poonami is killing me The delulu is deluluing for developers. Eh the parks offend me less than the buildings themselves, which are truly soulless 100%, corporate architects suck And that smell can be all yours every day for the low price of $4,800 a month The best pickles I have ever had in my life are from this location. Not sure I’d want to eat the vegetables grown on the roof  if you visit there in the spring, you are bound to see a body float up as the water warms It is absolutely incredible that there are these giant expensive condos being built there and it’s a toxic river. $2.5m for a studio apartment next to toxic site that has cancer causing chemicals. 🔥 It’s very cute love the fridge on the sidewalk to take and give food The Seine-ification of the gowanus canal I feel like I’d come out of the water with a shark fin and a third nipple if I swam in the canal 💀", "google_reviews": "I was in search of a facility to practice the swimming portion of my triathlon training. The Gowanus Canal was a fantastic spot. I did unfortunately grow a third arm which disqualified me from the competition but my swimming skills and overall health have never been better. Amazing canal, went on fishing and swimming. Really fun, but also the ship we were on sank because apparently the water dissolved the metal but I took a sip, I was fine, for a few minutes, at least. Took a little trip to the ER because of \"di-sin-terry\" or something, sounds like some random dudes name, so whoever that was, screw yourself.\nSwimming was fun for me and the kids too. There were some substances floating around, we thought it was face wash, what perfect timing! We're in the water, and plus my skin's been a bit bad recently, so thank god for that, it gave me little bumps on my face, so free cosmetic surgery. While swimming, everyone turned a tad bit green so my nephew said to my brother, \"Daddy, daddy, look! I'm turning into the Hulk!\". The water felt spicy, like a massage but also as if there were boiling water being poured onto me - sorry, no - being in a pool of boiling water.\nOnto the fish, it tasted really good, had some cod, looked a little discolored but hey, it's a tiny bit, right? Right? Yeah..\nDrove back home as usual, was pretty wet and the leather seat cover melted a bit, but like, that happens all the time, if you use common sense.\nOverall, the Gowanus Canal is a great stay and definitely somewhere you should visit in the summer. Have fun, and don't meet dice-in-teary, or whatever their name was. Went here to see a gig at public records. Had a great night, but unfortunately my phone died. One star for phone charging opportunities. Lovely honeymoon spot, went a canoe ride with my sweetheart in it. We fed the dolphins before they died from an unknown illness. I would recommend a visit, do not be a afraid to get wet. The water in the canal is good for the skin, and is proven to be affective in reducing wrinkles.  Water is prestige and beautiful. I would highly recommend this tremendous experience. The beautiful, green water provides a rustic charm with its fascinating oil splotches and the array of different colored garbage floating in the water. The lovely aroma of algae, sediment and decaying organisms adds to the whole experience. The only downfall was the oysters. I had heard that there were oysters in the Gowanus Canal, so I arrived at the canal with a few friends for dinner. There were some oyster cages in the canal, so we pulled them up. We pulled some up, and to our surprise, they were already dressed in a spectacular, gelatin like dark sauce. Excited, we set out our picnic blanket and got our plates and filled them up. The oysters tasted a little gritty, but otherwise they were superb. We finished up our dinner and walked around the Canal, taking in the view. About 30 minutes after dinner, we started to feel a little off. We thought nothing of it, and continued to enjoy our evening. We awoke a week later in the hospital. It turns out we had convulsed near the canal and hour after dinner and a few very generous people called an ambulance for us. I now have typhoid, pneumonia and dysentary, and have also suffered kidney failure. Despite the diseases I have contracted and the fact that I'm hosting an ever growing colony of toxic oysters that are slowly eating away my body, I had an exquisite experience at the Gowanus Canal.I must go now, for the Queen Oyster requires a constant diet of antelope skin and oval-tine. Swimming might result in Typhoid,Cholera.\nThe soft shell crabs are to die for! Fun to magnet fish. Landed lots of metal. Wear gloves. Water isn't... The cleanest. The canal looks less disgusting these days, especially since there's been an attempt to clean it up with all the development happening in the area. Pretty sure it still stinks and glows at times... lovely vacation destination. water temperature was nice, but all the toxic waste and trash kind of ruined the experience for me. I once saw a shopping cart floating on top of the water in the Gowanus. It was 1989. The Army Corp of engineers cleaned it since then and I want to know what they found!! How many bodies? Guns? Knives? Water temperature was nice, however the heavy metals poisoning I received from swimming wasn’t. 2 star Interesting reading about this place. But it missed one pop culture reference which actually got me to look it up in the first place. In the mid-80s movie Heaven Help Us, starring Andrew McCarthy and Mary Stuart Masterson, one of my favorite movies, there is a scene featuring the canal. The kid Ed Rooney, played by Kevin Dillon, borrows his father's car for a date after a high school dance. He parks the car on the bridge (probably the Carroll Street bridge) for some reason, while finding a quiet place among the industrial wasteland surrounding the canal to makeout with his date. Very funny scene when they get stuck as the bridge is being opened for an approaching boat. Movie also has appearances by Larry \"Bud\" Melman as the bridge tender, Donald Sutherland as the headmaster, and Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson. Nice place to walk or sit and reflect with in your self. The canal just a few years ago you could walk across it.(sludge. Etc..) now it has been changed by man and nature. Amazing. Swimming in it was fun ig\n\nBut my skin is sloughing off now so there's that Too much pesticides, not enough mercury Great swim spot for the whole family 4X STARS FOR SCENIC BEAUTY, BUT ANNOYED AT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND A GOOD MATTRESS.

Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.\n\nA cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women’s movements have constructed ‘women’s experience’, as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women’s experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.\n\nContemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs—creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg ‘sex’ restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984’s US defence budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michel Foucault’s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field.\n\nBy the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. This cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the traditions of ‘Western’ science and politics—the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other—the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This essay is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein, the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival.[1]\n\nThe cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense – a ‘final’ irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the ‘West’s’ escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self—untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the ‘Western’, humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature.[2] The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as Star Wars.\n\nThe cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein’s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection—they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.\n\nI will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this essay, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks — language, tool use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse.\n\nBiological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary.[3] The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signaling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal disturbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.\n\nThe second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man’s dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.\n\nTechnological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world.[4] ‘Textualization’ of everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived relations of domination that ground the ‘play’ of arbitrary reading.[5] It is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature—a source of insight and promise of innocence—is undermined, probably fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology grounding ‘Western’ epistemology. But the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism destroying ‘man’ by the ‘machine’ or ‘meaningful political action’ by the ‘text’. Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees and artefacts have politics, so why shouldn’t we (de Waal, 1982; Winner, 1980)?\n\nThe third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances[6] as a marker of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father’s ubiquity and spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as preeminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile—a matter of immense human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.\n\nThe ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially. They are about consciousness—or its simulation.[7] They are floating signifiers moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings of the displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the ‘hardest’ science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are ‘no more’ than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, ‘no more’ than the experience of stress. The nimble fingers of ‘Oriental’ women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon Victorian girls with doll’s houses, women’s enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail[8] whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.\n\nSo my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artefacts associated with ‘high technology’ and scientific culture. From One-Dimensional-Man (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.\n\nFrom one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women’s bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools of technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form that actually manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists long enough to disarm the state. Fission Impossible is the name of the affinity group in my town. (Affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidly.)[9]\n\nFractured Identities\nIt has become difficult to name one’s feminism by a single adjective—or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis for belief in ‘essential’ unity. There is nothing about teeing ‘female’ that naturally binds women. There is not even such a state as ‘being’ female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as ‘us’ in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a potent political myth called ‘us’, and what could motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women’s dominations of each other. For me—and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies—the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition—affinity, not identity.[10]\n\nChela Sandoval (n.d., 1984), from a consideration of specific historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of colour, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called ‘oppositional consciousness’, born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. ‘Women of color’, a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in ‘Western’ traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said about other possible postmodernisms. Sandoval’s oppositional consciousness is about contradictory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and pluralisms.\n\nSandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of colour. She notes that the definition of the group has been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called women and blacks’, who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category ‘woman’ negated all non-white women; ‘black’ negated all non-black people, as well as all black women. But there was also no ‘she’, no singularity, but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.[11] Unlike the ‘woman’ of some streams of the white women’s movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available through the power of oppositional consciousness.\n\nSandoval’s argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; that is to say, discourse dissolving the ‘West’ and its highest product—the one who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists.[12] Sandoval argues that ‘women of colour’ have a chance to build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.\n\nKatie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/poetic mechanics of identification built into reading ‘the poem’, that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among contemporary feminists from different ‘moments’ or ‘conversations’ in feminist practice to taxonomize the women’s movement to make one’s own political tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology.[13] Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women’s experience. And of course, ‘women’s culture’, like women of colour, is consciously created by mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of poetry, music, and certain forms of academic practice have been preeminent. The politics of race and culture in the US women’s movements are intimately interwoven. The common achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political unity without relying on a logic of appropriation, incorporation, and taxonomic identification.\n\nThe theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifications for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scientism, and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint. I think that radical and socialist/Marxist-feminisms have also undermined their/our own epistemological strategies and that this is a crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all ‘epistemologies’ as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build effective affinities.\n\nIt is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand-points, epistemologies as achievements of people committed to changing the world, has been part of the process showing the limits of identification. The acid tools of postmodernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body. But with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naiveté of innocence. But what would another political myth for socialist-feminism look like? What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective—and, ironically, socialist-feminist?\n\nI do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of ‘race’, ‘gender’, ‘sexuality’, and ‘class’. I also do not know of any other time when the kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of ‘us’ have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape of reality to any of ‘them’. Or at least ‘we’ cannot claim innocence from practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists, discovered (that is, were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence of the category ‘woman’. That consciousness changes the geography of all previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein. Cyborg feminists have to argue that ‘we’ do not want any more natural matrix of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the reflexive strategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so prophetically ends salvation history.\n\nBoth Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simultaneously naturalized and denatured the category ‘woman’ and consciousness of the social lives of ‘women’. Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labour which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice. Labour is the preeminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing the world. Labour is the humanizing activity that makes man; labour is an ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge of subjugation and alienation.\n\nIn faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by allying itself with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement of both Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labour to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist patriarchy. In particular, women’s labour in the household and women’s activity as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense), entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labour. The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological structure of ‘labour’. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not ‘naturalize’ unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure of labour or of its analogue, women’s activity.[14] The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its preeminently Western self, is the difficulty for me. The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize them.\n\nCatherine MacKinnon’s (1982, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action.[15] It is factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse ‘moments’ or ‘conversations’ in recent women’s politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon’s version. But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology—including their negations—erase or police difference. Only one of the effects of MacKinnon’s theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory of experience, of women’s identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this tale of radical feminism achieves its end—the unity of women—by enforcing the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon’s theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.\n\nMacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analytical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men’s constitution and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon’s ‘ontology’ constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another’s desire, not the self’s labour, is the origin of ‘woman’. She therefore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can count as ‘women’s’ experience—anything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as ‘women’ can be concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; that is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.\n\nPerversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemological status of labour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual objectification, not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product, but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by another’s desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent separation of the labourer from his product.\n\nMacKinnon’s radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme; it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other women’s political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing—feminists’ consciousness of the non-existence of women, except as products of men’s desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly ground women’s unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions of any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon’s intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the ‘essential’ non-existence of women is not reassuring.\n\nIn my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist feminists as forms of labour only if the activity can somehow be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies, one rooted in labour, one in sex, both calling the consequences of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality ‘false consciousness’.\n\nBeyond either the difficulties or the contributions in the argument of any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how else could the ‘Western’ author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex other forms of domination by expanding its basic categories through analogy, simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence. History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure of my caricature looks like this:\n\nsocialist-feminism –\n\nstructure of class // wage labour // alienation\n\nlabour, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race\n\nradical feminism –\n\nstructure of gender // sexual appropriation // objectification\n\nsex, by analogy labour, by extension reproduction, by addition race\n\nIn another context, the French theorist, Julia Kristeva, claimed women appeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along with groups like youth.[16] Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to remembering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, ‘race’ did not always exist, ‘class’ has a historical genesis, and ‘homosexuals’ are quite junior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man—and so the essence of woman—breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex. ‘Advanced capitalism’ is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical moment. In the ‘Western’ sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed women’s particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world historical systems of domination. ‘Epistemology’ is about knowing the difference.\n\nThe Informatics of Domination\nIn this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrangements in world-wide social relations tied to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system—from all work to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination:\n\nTransitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks of informatics of domination.\nOrganics of Domination\tInformatics of Domination\nRepresentation\tSimulation\nBourgeois novel, realism\tScience fiction, postmodernism\nOrganism\tBiotic Component\nDepth, integrity\tSurface, boundary\nHeat\tNoise\nBiology as clinical practice\tBiology as inscription\nPhysiology\tCommunications engineering\nSmall group\tSubsystem\nPerfection\tOptimization\nEugenics\tPopulation Control\nDecadence, Magic Mountain\tObsolescence, Future Shock\nHygiene\tStress Management\nMicrobiology, tuberculosis\tImmunology, AIDS\nOrganic division of labour\tErgonomics/cybernetics of labour\nFunctional specialization\tModular construction\nReproduction\tReplication\nOrganic sex role specialization\tOptimal genetic strategies\nBiological determinism\tEvolutionary inertia, constraints\nCommunity ecology\tEcosystem\nRacial chain of being\tNeo-imperialism, United Nations humanism\nScientific management in home/factory\tGlobal factory/Electronic cottage\nFamily/Market/Factory\tWomen in the Integrated Circuit\nFamily wage\tComparable worth\nPublic/Private\tCyborg citizenship\nNature/Culture\tfields of difference\nCo-operation\tCommunications enhancement\nFreud\tLacan\nSex\tGenetic engineering\nLabour\tRobotics\nMind\tArtificial Intelligence\nSecond World War\tStar Wars\nWhite Capitalist Patriarchy\tInformatics of Domination\nThis list suggests several interesting things.[17] First, the objects on the right-hand side cannot be coded as ‘natural’, a realization that subverts naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically or materially. It’s not just that ‘god’ is dead; so is the ‘goddess’. Or both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly unmasking the irrationalism.\n\nLikewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is ‘irrational’ to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized. For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives way to a new practice called ‘experimental ethnography’ in which an organic object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development and under-development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no ‘natural’ architectures constrain system design. The financial districts in all the world’s cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade zones, proclaim this elementary fact of ‘late capitalism’. The entire universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems in communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text (for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.\n\nOne should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries—and not on the integrity of natural objects. ‘Integrity’ or ‘sincerity’ of the Western self gives way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied to women’s capacities to give birth to new human beings will be developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this universe is stress—communications breakdown (Hogness, 1983). The cyborg is not subject to Foucault’s biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field of operations.\n\nThis kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in ‘the West’ since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia (1984) might put it, they have been ‘techno-digested’. The dichotomies between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and communication called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself—all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others—consequences that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.\n\nCommunications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other.\n\nFurthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed by a common move—the translation of the world into a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.\n\nIn communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can be condensed into the metaphor C3I, command-control communication-intelligence, the military’s symbol for its operations theory.\n\nIn modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into problems of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs research broadly.[18] In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information-processing devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference between self and other. Human babies with baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity—for animal rights activists at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men and intravenous drug users are the ‘privileged’ victims of an awful immune system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987).\n\nBut these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transformations in the structure of the world for us. Communications technologies depend on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power, welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our imaginations, labour-control systems, medical constructions of our bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Micro-electronics is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals.\n\nMicroelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies, and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies concern more than human reproduction. Biology as a powerful engineering science for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentation, agriculture, and energy. Communications sciences and biology are constructions of natural-technical objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The ‘multinational’ material organization of the production and reproduction of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed more feasible.\n\nI have used Rachel Grossman’s (1980) image of women in the integrated circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured through the social relations of science and technology.[19] I used the odd circumlocution, the social relations of science and technology, to indicate that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour, 1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics.\n\nThe ‘Homework Economy’ Outside ‘The Home’\nThe ‘New Industrial Revolution’ is producing a new world-wide working class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities. The extreme mobility of capital and the emerging international division of labour are intertwined with the emergence of new collectivities, and the weakening of familiar groupings. These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men. It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred labour force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors, particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and involves reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumption, and production. In the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women’s lives have been structured around employment in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin or most other forms of traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences in culture, family, religion, education, and language.\n\nRichard Gordon has called this new situation the ‘homework economy’.[20] Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in connection with electronics assembly, Gordon intends ‘homework economy’ to name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being redefined as both literally female and feminized, whether performed by men or women. To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less as workers than as servers; subjected to some arrangements on and off the paid job that make a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the concept indicates that factory, home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial—and need to be analysed for differences among women and for meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.\n\nThe homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The success of the attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men’s unionized jobs is deaf to the power of the new communications technologies to integrate and control labour despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences of the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family (male) wage (if they ever had access to this white privilege) and in the character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for example, office work and nursing.\n\nThe new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old people. The feminization of poverty—generated by dismantling the welfare state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and sustained by the expectation that women’s wages will not be matched by a male income for the support of children—has become an urgent focus. The causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions of women on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a function of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind of integration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is new. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have achieved an escape from (barely) paid domestic service and who now hold clerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implications for continued enforced black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas of the Third World increasingly find themselves the sole or major source of a cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problematic. These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and politics of gender and race.\n\nWithin the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commercial/early industrial, monopoly, multinational)—tied to nationalism, imperialism, and multinationalism, and related to Jameson’s three dominant aesthetic periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism—I would argue that specific forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally, ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and private and accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced) by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions represented in Greenwich Village around the First World War; and (3) the ‘family’ of the homework economy with its oxymoronic structure of women-headed households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself.\n\nThis is the context in which the projections for world-wide structural unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture of the homework economy. As robotics and related technologies put men out of work in ‘developed’ countries and exacerbate failure to generate male jobs in Third World ‘development’, and as the automated office becomes the rule even in labour-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies. Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face the structural underemployment (‘feminization’) of black men, as well as their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and community life are interwoven with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just nice.\n\nThe new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food production for subsistence world-wide. Rae Lessor Blumberg (1983) estimates that women produce about 50 per cent of the world’s subsistence food.[21] Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased high-tech commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous because their responsibilities to provide food do not diminish, and their reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions of labour and differential gender migration patterns.\n\nThe new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of ‘privatization’ that Ros Petchesky (1981) has analysed, in which militarization, right-wing family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate (and state) property as private synergistically interact.[22] The new communications technologies are fundamental to the eradication of ‘public life’ for everyone. This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military establishment at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially of women. Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televisions seem crucial to production of modern forms of ‘private life’. The culture of video games is heavily orientated to individual competition and extraterrestrial warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations that can contemplate destruction of the planet and a sci-fi escape from its consequences. More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable. These are the technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect exchange—and incidentally enable tourism, that perfect practice of mobility and exchange, to emerge as one of the world’s largest single industries.\n\nThe new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and of reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sexuality and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction- and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles.[23] These sociobiological stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive situations is the medical one, where women’s bodies have boundaries newly permeable to both ‘visualization’ and ‘intervention’. Of course, who controls the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneutics is a major feminist issue. The speculum served as an icon of women’s claiming their bodies in the 1970S; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduction. Self-help is not enough. The technologies of visualization recall the important cultural practice of handing with the camera and the deeply predatory nature of a photographic consciousness.[24] Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of personal and social possibility.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies is the reformulation of expectations, culture, work, and reproduction for the large scientific and technical work-force. A major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of colour, confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several varieties, and general redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.[25]\n\nThis issue is only one aspect of enquiry into the possibility of a feminist science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have? How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements? What kind of political accountability can be constructed to the women together across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with and-military science facility conversion action groups? Many scientific and technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do not want to work on military science.[26] Can these personal preferences and cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this professional middle class in which women, including women of colour, are coming to be fairly numerous?\n\nWomen in The Integrated Circuit\nLet me summarize the picture of women’s historical locations in advanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women’s lives by the distinction of public and private domains—suggested by images of the division of working-class life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and of gender existence into personal and political realms—it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. ‘Networking’ is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy—weaving is for oppositional cyborgs.\n\nSo let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination and trace one vision of women’s ‘place’ in the integrated circuit, touching only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work. However, there is no ‘place’ for women in these networks, only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women’s cyborg identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life, we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the following list from a standpoint of ‘identification’, of a unitary self. The issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.\n\nHome: Women-headed households, serial monogamy, flight of men, old women alone, technology of domestic work, paid homework, re-emergence of home sweat-shops, home-based businesses and telecommuting, electronic cottage, urban homelessness, migration, module architecture, reinforced (simulated) nuclear family, intense domestic violence.\n\nMarket: Women’s continuing consumption work, newly targeted to buy the profusion of new production from the new technologies (especially as the competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid dangerous mass unemployment necessitates finding ever bigger new markets for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled with advertising targeting of the numerous affluent groups and neglect of the previous mass markets; growing importance of informal markets in labour and commodities parallel to high-tech, affluent market structures; surveillance systems through electronic funds transfer; intensified market abstraction (commodification) of experience, resulting in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme mobility (abstraction) of marketing/financing systems; inter-penetration of sexual and labour markets; intensified sexualization of abstracted and alienated consumption.\n\nPaid Work Place: Continued intense sexual and racial division of labour, but considerable growth of membership in privileged occupational categories for many white women and people of colour; impact of new technologies on women’s work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles), agriculture, electronics; international restructuring of the working classes; development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy (flex time, part time, over time, no time); homework and out work; increased pressures for two-tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people in cash-dependent populations world-wide with no experience or no further hope of stable employment; most labour ‘marginal’ or ‘feminized’.\n\nState: Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with increased surveillance and control; citizenship by telematics; imperialism and political power broadly in the form of information rich/information poor differentiation; increased high-tech militarization increasingly opposed by many social groups; reduction of civil service jobs as a result of the growing capital intensification of office work, with implications for occupational mobility for women of colour; growing privatization of material and ideological life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization, the high-tech forms of bourgeois capitalist personal and public life; invisibility of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms of belief in abstract enemies.\n\nSchool: Deepening coupling of high-tech capital needs and public education at all levels, differentiated by race, class, and gender; managerial classes involved in educational reform and refunding at the cost of remaining progressive educational democratic structures for children and teachers; education for mass ignorance and repression in technocratic and militarized culture; growing and-science mystery cults in dissenting and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy among white women and people of colour; growing industrial direction of education (especially higher education) by science-based multinationals (particularly in electronics- and biotechnology-dependent companies); highly educated, numerous elites in a progressively bimodal society.\n\nClinic-hospital: Intensified machine-body relations; renegotiations of public metaphors which channel personal experience of the body, particularly in relation to reproduction, immune system functions, and ‘stress’ phenomena; intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical implications of women’s unrealized, potential control of their relation to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles over meanings and means of health in environments pervaded by high technology products and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified struggle over state responsibility for health; continued ideological role of popular health movements as a major form of American politics.\n\nChurch: Electronic fundamentalist ‘super-saver’ preachers solemnizing the union of electronic capital and automated fetish gods; intensified importance of churches in resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women’s meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality, intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle.\n\nThe only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is plain. There is much now being done, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collective struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU’s District 925,[27] should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the largely white male industrial unions.\n\nThe structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be ultimately depressed by the implications of late twentieth-century women’s relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and people’s complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women’s points of view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unities mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of ‘clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology’ versus ‘manipulated false consciousness’, but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of the game.\n\nThere are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of hardship experienced world-wide in connection with the social relations of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack sufficiently subtle connections for collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts—Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological—to clarify even ‘our’ experience are rudimentary.\n\nI am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position—a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik’s impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as by the women’s movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing on the present defeats.\n\nThe permanent partiality of feminist points of view has consequences for our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps, ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.\n\nCyborgs: A Myth of Political Identity\nI want to conclude with a myth about identity and boundaries which might inform late twentieth-century political imaginations. I am indebted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree Jr., Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda Mclntyre.[28] These are our story-tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high-tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring conceptions of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery is to world view, and so to political language. French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology, and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.[29] American radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations—and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.[30] They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval’s terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilities inherent in the breakdown of clean distinctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political ‘technological’ pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.\n\nEarlier I suggested that ‘women of colour’ might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities, sedimented in the complex political-historical layerings of Audre Lorde’s ‘biomythography’, Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential. Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy preventing their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. ‘Women of colour’ are the preferred labour force for the science-based industries, the real women for whom the world-wide sexual market, labour market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the ‘cheap’ female labour so attractive to the multinationals.\n\nContrary to orientalist stereotypes of the ‘oral primitive’, literacy is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and writing. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in ‘postmodernist’ theories attacking the phallogocentrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.[31] Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.\n\nThe tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentric origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies—technologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics—that have recently textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.\n\nFiguratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings of the story of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo ‘bastard’ race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983) in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother’s or father’s.[32] Moraga’s writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche’s mastery of the conqueror’s language—a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga’s language is not ‘whole’; it is self-consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror’s languages. But it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga’s body, affirms it as the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of ‘original illiteracy’ of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.\n\nWriting is preeminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of ‘Western’ identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. ‘We’ did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of ‘texts’.\n\nFrom the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in ‘our’ privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile ‘masculine’ separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize ‘oneself’ as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed her from the evil mother of masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.\n\nThis is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every, story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics—rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many times a ‘western’ commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by ‘Western’ technology, by writing.[33] These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japanese and US electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and societies.[34] Survival is the stakes in this play of readings.\n\nTo recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals—in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.\n\nHigh-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture’s fear, love, and confusion.\n\nOne consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices.[35] Anne McCaffrey’s pre-feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl’s brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century till now, machines could be animated—given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacities. Or organisms could be mechanized—reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don’t need organic holism to give impermeable wholeness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.\n\nThe cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual entity, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader’s search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly manly until her ‘true’ gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of time warps that bring a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community of an adopted cross-species child who came to know the enemy as self (Survivor). In Dawn (1987), the first instalment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam’s first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who reform earth’s habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguistic, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth-century race and gender.\n\nBecause it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIntyre’s Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is ‘simply’ human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Lacnea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and intimacy even in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this essay. This is a conjunction with a long history that many ‘First World’ feminists have tried to repress, including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account by Zoe Sofoulis, whose different location in the world system’s informatics of domination made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction cultures, including women’s science fiction. From an Australian feminist sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre’s role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV’s Star Trek series than her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.\n\nMonsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centred polis of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases—all crucial to establishing modern identity.[36] The evolutionary and behavioral sciences of monkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries of late twentieth-century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.\n\nThere are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.\n\nThe ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life. But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men’s access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination—in order to act potently.\n\nOne last image: organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.\n\nCyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skillful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess."}
