What if they built a 8, maybe 10 inch pipe under Degraw St. from the port right by where 478 crosses under the water, straight up to where Degraw dead ends at the canal, then bust a left to go up to the very tippy top of the canal. Then put a pump on the end that's out in the bay and run it when tides are going out. Pump fresh ish water from the bay to the top of the canal. It'll eventually flush it out and supply a constant flow of fresher water... It wouldn't be quick. You don't wanna shock the rest of the bay with the pollution. Maybe wait until the first big rainstorm after construction to turn the pumps on for the first flush. Work WITH the bay and the tides and rain and whatever other factors and slowly start flushing it... I think it could work... You'd also still have to fix the things that are still polluting the water... But it's doable...",

They actually dug almost 300 feet down into the soil & at times hitting bedrock & still coming up with chemicals & toxins from close to 200 years ago. It's crazy how that stuff never disappears. But when that job is all complete the area & the canal will be clean enough to go kayaking & MAYBE even swimming. They are installing underground 12million gallon storage & overflow tanks, filtration systems which will clean up the canal & also stop the flooding problems in the area when it rains hard & also a beautiful park. It's gonna be great for the neighborhood. But like everything, some people always have to pay a price. And knock on wood it's not my brother or any other worker there in their futures breathing & being exposed to all that crap every day.",

    "text": "When my kids were young in the 90's I had a small wooden boat that I kept out at Dead Horse Bay, but I'd sail it to the canal, then motor all the way up to Union Street or Caroll street and moor it. We'd get in and out by climbing up the sides of the bridges. Their mother lived just up on President street, and I across fourth avenue, on Sackett. A lot of the waterfront was still almost lawless then. Nobody stopped you, or demanded permits or anything like that. People would live all Summer on the beaches out near Jamaica bay, unbothered by the law.  Even well into the 2000's we'd cart a big expedition kayak I had down there and paddle out to the bay. It was a magic time, because the water was no longer as hideously foul as it had been, but it was before the 1% bought it all for development. We could even get in and out of the boat directly onto Second Street, which was at the time just a bleak dead end where the working girls would bring their customers, and people would burn cars for the insurance money.  The canal was never naturally so foul--it became so because of the exit tunnel was broken for so many years.",

    "text": "Skipper Matt, I'm finding the same amazement every single adventure you complete and translate into the most riveting videos. Your acumen with the kayak, canoes and urban exploring gets superb video presentation. The collage of water sights at the end, the closing segment with the young geese (A collection of geese on the water is commonly called a plump. I looked it up!) and the music begins to play....was delightful. In your many videos, sometimes far shots show you operate while the distant camera follows you is a Felix the Cat Bag o' Tricks item. For example in this Gowanus Canal episode, when you were all packed up climbing the ladder made it seem like you had a camera man covering your climb, but I figure you got something robotic going on.....and PLEASE, keep it your secret, your trade secret and just let me guess how you do it! I love the modern gear you employ young Man including the amazing kayak. As I traveled all the boroughs and Long Island and the Jersey side of the NY Metro region in my working years, I've seen many strange, scary and wonderful things. But never have I seen anyone climb out of any urban waterway with a huge boat backpack in tow and just pop up on the street ready to find a bodega and get a Coke! You're looking mighty fine with the new warm season upon us, a champion's look. Thank you and continue safe practice. 💯💫🍒🌎",

Today, car culture ruins so many cities that could be so much nicer if people just slowed down. Just look at the backlash from motorists about bike lanes stealing parking spots or other berating of \"15 minute cities\".\n\nIn a hundred years, all these beautiful waterways will be stocked with speed boats throwing wake constantly and yelling at kayaks and canoes to \"GET OUTTA THE WAY!\"\n\nI'm also reminded of Disney's Motor Mania from the 1950s! Even then we knew things were bad!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwPSIb3kt_4",

My friends and I explored the Gowanus Bat Cave along the canal about a decade ago before it was redeveloped. I never knew that ship, the Loujane was there (just did some research and apparently it was owned by a Saudi cement/construction company and went out of use in the 80s!) That whole area and its eerie industrial feel always fascinated me. So cool seeing someone explore my backyard up close!",

Great to hear it's being cleaned but the soil on the bottom is what really needs to be removed.",

That the water would ever become clean enough to swim in is really questionable, as there will always be sewage at least flowing into some parts of the canal during periods of extreme rainfall. Kayaking is one thing, but swimming without extremely high-quality protective gear? I don't think so.",

When that was one of the favorite places, people dump in bodies.  Cause it was polluted when rats and rats would eat whatever was whatever fell into the water. I remember going to group on my friends couple of times in the summer, we usually tie chicken bones and stuff to strengthen the rope and throw it in there and fight with the rats, at least we think there were rats, water rats.  They supposed to be big.\n Insurance, but I don't know what pulled it cause. We never really saw it cause. The water was so dark and dirty. So it might be stories or there might be a couple of million people in there. A couple tons of guns that we use in violence and nights. Oh, somebody in the government's gonna realize this.  I don't think all these plans.You're gonna go through right away.Cause every time they dig up a body that's a lot of money spent",

The remaining water mixture is purified to the point of being drinkable.  The water is sent to the Ohio River to provide water for Cincinnati. \nSide factoid: During the drought of 1988, Pittsburgh sent less water down to Cincinnati.   Pittsburgh dams held back water for Cincinnati. \nDumping raw sewage into the canal is so uncivilized.   If New York asked Pittsburgh, we'd show you how to treat water, then you will be able to eat your clams.",

    "text": "I love your video, huge fan. But this one tickled my itch. I don't like this, to start with mankind took a natural environment and polluted it, terraformed it and transformed it into its current form today. Nature was devastated by this process but whilst there was a massive ecological impact life survived, adapted and evolved. That is where we are today. Now mankind is trying to 'restore' the previous natural state of the waterway. The process to achieve that is invasive sudden and severe chemical and physical alteration. This is as abrupt and destructive to the current natural state as was the original desecration. You are repeating the error. if you want this to transform back to its natural state. To heal. Stop! Stop all human intervention and activity. Let nature reclaim and rehabilitate in her own way. Anything else is just furthering the original thinking and destruction, for the sake of what 'looks good' to people. When are we going to stop destroying our environment whilst all along thinking we know best and that we are good? There is no greater evil than this.",

Pretty sure anything with the words “green” in it was just defunded by the doge $2 trilly recovery squad and the mess made all for $150 billion “in savings” (erasing US soft power globally) for the US govt not even remotely touching the military?? What a freaking joke man. Sad that projects like this will no longer get govt funding to clean up if they were already which imo they should be. We needed that infrastructure money bad! Things are crumbling and for some reason we gotta constantly only pay attention to what books shouldn’t be  in classrooms and other craziness!!",

My mother, 3 sisters, uncle and his wife, all died from cancer. All between the ages of mid 40's to late 50's - no one made it past 60, mostly Leukemia and lung, organ cancers.
